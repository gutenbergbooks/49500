    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is the chief object of the following narrative to give an account of
      the treason of Arnold, its causes, the plans for carrying it forward, and
      its final issue. In executing this design, it was necessary to touch upon
      the events of his previous life; and, as many of these have a real
      interest in themselves, and others a direct bearing on the subject, it is
      believed no apology for introducing them will be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author has of course consulted all the printed books and documents,
      which he could find; and among others he acknowledges his obligation to M.
      de Mar-bois' Complot d'Arnold et de Sir Henry Clinton, published several
      years ago in Paris, and soon afterwards translated by Mr. Walsh for the
      second volume of the American Register. The parts of M. de Marbois' book,
      which he wrote from personal knowledge and observation, have a special
      value; some of the other parts would have been varied, if his materials
      had been more abundant and exact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides printed sources of information, the author has been fortunate in
      procuring the use of a large number of original papers in manuscript,
      which have not before been inspected. In the public archives of London he
      was allowed to peruse the entire correspondence, between the British
      commander in America and the ministry, concerning Arnold's defection;
      particularly a very ample narrative of all the transactions, dated nine
      days after the death of André, methodically drawn up, and signed by Sir
      Henry Clinton. This correspondence exhibits in a clear view the British
      side of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among General Washington's manuscripts are also original materials,
      including the papers that were laid before the board of general officers
      to whom Andre's case was submitted, and the drafts of letters and other
      papers left behind by Arnold when he escaped. Arnold's letters to Congress
      are curious, and indicate the workings of his mind while maturing his
      plot. The same may be said of some of his miscellaneous letters, which
      have fallen into the author's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that portion of the narrative in which the agency of André is
      described, the principal authority has been the records of the trial of
      Joshua H. Smith. This person was arraigned before a court-martial, upon
      the charge of having been an accomplice with Arnold, but his guilt was not
      proved. The trial lasted for nearly a month. Numerous witnesses were
      examined, and among others the captors of André. All the testimony was
      taken down in detail, and the papers have been preserved. They are
      voluminous and important.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several gentlemen now living, who were personally acquainted with
      circumstances attending the treason of Arnold, have made valuable
      communications, either written or verbal, for the present work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author will only add, that he has everywhere aimed at strict accuracy
      in his viii statements, and verified them whenever it was possible by
      reference to manuscript authorities. If his labors should be found to have
      contributed any thing to illustrate an interesting point of history, his
      end will be answered and his wishes gratified.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <i>Arnold's Birth and Early Life.</i>
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>mong the first
      settlers and proprietors of Rhode Island was William Arnold, a name of
      some note in the local annals of his time. He had three sons, Benedict,
      Thomas, and Stephen. The eldest, that is, Benedict Arnold, succeeded Roger
      Williams as president of the colony under the first charter, and he was at
      different times governor under the second charter during a period of
      fifteen years; a proof of the respect in which he was held by his
      contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family spread out into several branches. One of these was established
      at Newport, from which place two brothers, Benedict Arnold and Oliver
      Arnold, emigrated to Norwich in Connecticut, the former about the year
      1730, or perhaps a little earlier, the latter several years afterwards.
      They were coopers by trade, but Benedict discontinued that occupation soon
      after his removal to Norwich, and engaged in commerce. He made one or two
      voyages to England, but was principally concerned in navigation to the
      West Indies, and was owner of the vessels he commanded. Having accumulated
      means sufficient to enable him to change this pursuit for one which he
      liked better, he became a merchant, and for several years carried on an
      extensive business at Norwich. He was a man of suspicious integrity,
      little respected, and less esteemed. Prosperity deserted him, and by
      degrees he sank into intemperance, poverty, and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time he had married Mrs. Hannah King, a widow lady, whose name
      before her first marriage was Waterman. Her family connexions were highly
      respectable, and she is represented as having been eminent for her amiable
      temper, piety, and Christian virtues. The children of this second marriage
      were three sons and three daughters. Benedict, the eldest, died in
      infancy. The same name was given to the next son. Of the six children,
      only he and his sister Hannah survived the years of childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Benedict Arnold</i>, the second son above named, and the subject of
      this notice, was born at Norwich, on the 3d of January, 1740. As his
      father's affairs were then in a successful train, it is probable he
      enjoyed the advantage of as good schools as the town or its vicinity
      afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time he was under the tuition of Dr. Jewett, a teacher of some
      celebrity at Montville. There is no evidence, however, that his
      acquirements reached beyond those usually attained in the common schools.
      While yet a lad he was apprenticed to two gentlemen by the name of
      Lathrop, who were partners as druggists in a large establishment at
      Norwich, and alike distinguished for their probity, worth, and the wide
      extent of their business. Being allied by a distant relationship to the
      mother of the young apprentice, they felt a personal interest in his
      welfare, especially as no benefit to him was now to be hoped from the
      example or guidance of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was soon made obvious to these gentlemen, that they had neither an
      agreeable nor an easy task before them. To an innate love of mischief,
      young Arnold added an obduracy of conscience, a cruelty of disposition, an
      irritability of temper, and a reckless indifference to the good or ill
      opinion of others, that left but a slender foundation upon which to erect
      a system of correct principles or habits. Anecdotes have been preserved
      illustrative of these traits. One of his earliest amusements was the
      robbing of birds' nests, and it was his custom to maim and mangle young
      birds in sight of the old ones, that he might be diverted by their cries.
      Near the druggist's shop was a schoolhouse, and he would scatter in the
      path broken pieces of glass taken from the crates, by which the children
      would cut their feet in coming from the school. The cracked and imperfect
      phials, which came in the crates, were perquisites of the apprentices.
      Hopkins, a fellow apprentice and an amiable youth, was in the habit of
      placing his share on the outside of the shop near the door, and permitting
      the small boys to take them away, who were pleased with this token of his
      good will. Arnold followed the same practice; but, when he had decoyed the
      boys, and they were busy in picking up the broken phials, he would rush
      out of the shop with a horsewhip in his hand, call them thieves, and beat
      them without mercy. These and similar acts afforded him pleasure. He was
      likewise fond of rash feats of daring, always foremost in danger, and as
      fearless as he was wickedly mischievous. Sometimes he took corn to a
      gristmill in the neighbourhood; and, while waiting for the meal, he would
      amuse himself and astonish his playmates, by clinging to the arms of a
      large water-wheel and passing with it beneath and above the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary of the monotonous duties of the shop, and smitten with the
      attractions of a military life, he enlisted as a soldier in the army
      without the knowledge of his friends when he was sixteen years old, and
      went off with other recruits to Hartford. This caused such deep distress
      to his mother, that the Reverend Dr. Lord, pastor of the church to which
      she belonged, and some other persons, took a lively interest in the
      matter, and succeeded in getting him released and brought back. Not long
      afterwards he ran away, enlisted a second time, and was stationed at
      Ticonderoga and different places on the frontiers; but being employed in
      garrison duty, and subjected to more restraint and discipline than were
      suited to his restless spirit and unyielding obstinacy, and seeing no
      prospect of an opportunity for gratifying his ambition and love of bold
      adventure, he deserted, returned to Norwich, and resumed his former
      employment. When a British officer passed through the town in pursuit of
      deserters, his friends, fearing a discovery, secreted him in a cellar till
      night, and then sent him several miles into the country, where he remained
      concealed till the officer was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of his apprenticeship he gave infinite trouble to Dr.
      Lathrop, in whose family he resided; and his conduct was a source of
      perpetual anxiety and grief to his mother. He was her only surviving son,
      her husband was lost to himself and to the world, and it was natural that
      the maternal hopes and fears of a lady of her sensibility and excellence
      should be powerfully wrought upon, by such wayward exhibitions of
      character in one, to whom she was bound by the strongest and tenderest
      ties, and on whom she relied as the support of her declining years. Borne
      down with the weight of present affliction, her forebodings of the future
      must have been melancholy and fearful. Heaven relieved her from the
      anguish of witnessing her son's career of ambition without virtue, of
      glory tarnished with crime, and of depravity ending in infamy and ruin.
      She died before he reached the age of manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had served out his apprenticeship, Arnold left Norwich and
      commenced business as a druggist in New Haven. He was assisted by his
      former masters in setting up his new establishment, which at first was on
      a small scale; but, by his enterprise and activity, his business was
      extended, and to the occupation of an apothecary he added that of a
      general merchant. At length he took up the profession of a navigator,
      shipped horses, cattle, and provisions to the West Indies, and commanded
      his own vessels. Turbulent, impetuous, presuming, and unprincipled, it was
      to be expected that he would raise up a host of enemies against him, and
      be involved in many difficulties. He fought a duel with a Frenchman
      somewhere in the West Indies, and was engaged in frequent quarrels both at
      home and abroad. His speculations ended in bankruptcy, and under
      circumstances, which, in the opinion of the world, left a stain upon his
      honesty and good faith. He resumed his business, and applied himself to it
      with his accustomed vigor and resource, and with the same obliquity of
      moral purpose, hazard, and disregard of public sentiment, that had always
      marked his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, just after he had returned from a West India voyage, a
      sailor who had been with him spread a report, that he had smuggled
      contraband goods and got them ashore without the knowledge of a
      custom-house officer. Arnold sought out the sailor, beat him severely, and
      compelled him to leave the town and take a solemn oath, that he would
      never enter it again. Within two or three days, however, the sailor was
      found in the streets; and Arnold collected a small party, seized him, and
      took him to the whipping-post, where about forty lashes were inflicted
      upon him with a small cord, and he was conducted a second time out of
      town. The affair was noised abroad, and excited the indignation of the
      populace. The sailor came back, and the case was submitted to Colonel
      Wooster and another gentleman, who, as Arnold said in his public
      vindication, "were of opinion, that the fellow was not whipped too much,
      and gave him fifty shillings damages only." He grounded this summary mode
      of punishment on what he considered the infamous nature of the offence,
      and its tendency to injure the community by casting suspicion upon honest
      dealers and obstructing the course of trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      An exploit is remembered, which was characteristic of his rashness and
      courage. While driving cattle on board a vessel, which he was freighting
      for a voyage, a refractory ox refused obedience. He grew furious, ran off,
      and set his pursuers at defiance. Arnold mounted a fleet horse, overtook
      the ox, seized the enraged animal by a tender part of the nostrils, and
      held him in that position till he was subdued and secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold's father died about the time he settled in New Haven, and his
      sister, Hannah Arnold, being the only remaining individual of the family,
      joined him at that place. He was early married at New Haven to a lady by
      the name of Mansfield. They had three sons, Benedict, Richard, and Henry.
      The first died young in the West Indies. He was a violent, headstrong
      youth, and it is supposed he came to an untimely end. He had a commission
      in the British service after the revolution. There is a letter written by
      Hannah Arnold, in which, after mentioning that this nephew had gone to the
      West Indies, she says, "He went entirely contrary to the wishes of his
      father; what has been his fate, God only knows, but my prophetic heart
      forbodes the worst." All accounts agree in extolling the accomplishments
      of this lady, her rare endowments of mind, her refinement, delicacy, and
      other qualities of female excellence. Several of her letters, which I have
      seen, fully justify this tribute to her good name, which dwelt on the lips
      of those that knew her, and which the voice of tradition has perpetuated.
      Her ardent and unceasing attachment to her brother, at the same time that
      it proves the depth of her own feelings, may argue the existence of better
      traits in his domestic character, than would be inferred from his public
      conduct. His sister was his devoted friend, his adviser, and a watchful
      guardian over his family and his interests. She adhered to him through
      good and evil report, and never forsook him, till he proved himself
      unworthy even of a sister's love. She lived many years after the war, at
      one time in Troy on Hudson's River, and afterwards near York, in Upper
      Canada, where it is believed she closed her days. Her two nephews, Richard
      and Henry, resided with her in Troy, and were employed in mercantile
      affairs. They likewise removed to Canada, where they received lands from
      the British government. The wife of Arnold died at New Haven about the
      time that the war began.

      <i>He begins his Military Career.&mdash;Capture of Ticonderoga and Crown
      Point.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here were in
      Connecticut two companies of militia called the Governor's Guards, and
      organized in conformity to an act of the legislature. One of these
      companies belonged to New Haven, and in March, 1775, Arnold was chosen to
      be its commander. This company consisted of fifty-eight men. When the news
      of the battle of Lexington reached New Haven, the bells were rung, and
      great excitement prevailed among the people. Moved by a common impulse,
      they assembled on the green in the centre of the town, where the Captain
      of the Guards took occasion to harangue the multitude, and, after
      addressing himself to their patriotic feelings, and rousing their martial
      spirit by suitable appeals and representations, he proposed to head any
      number of volunteers that would join him, and march with them immediately
      to the scene of action. He ended his address by appointing a time and
      place for all such to meet, and form themselves into a company.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hour arrived, sixty volunteers appeared on the ground, belonging
      mostly to the Guards, with a few students from the College. No time was
      lost in preparing for their departure, and on the morning of the next day
      they were ready to march. The company was destitute of ammunition, which
      the rulers of the town refused to supply, not being satisfied as to the
      expediency of taking up arms, or of abetting such a movement, without the
      previous direction or countenance of a higher authority. This was a point,
      which Arnold was not in the humor to discuss. He drew out his volunteers
      in martial array, and despatched a message to the Selectmen, stating that,
      unless the keys of the magazine were delivered to him immediately, he
      would break it open by force. This threat was effectual, and perhaps it
      was not reluctantly heeded by the Selectmen themselves, as it afforded an
      apology for their acquiescence. A sense of responsibility often excites
      quicker fears, than the distant and uncertain consequences of a rash
      action. Being thus provided, and participating the ardor of their leader,
      the company hastened forward by a rapid march to Cambridge, the
      head-quarters of the troops, who were collecting from various parts to
      resist any further aggressions from the British army in Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time a few individuals at Hartford, in Connecticut, where the
      legislature of the colony was then sitting, secretly formed a plan to
      surprise and capture Ticonderoga. It is probable, that Arnold had received
      a hint of this project before he left New Haven; for, as soon as he
      arrived in Cambridge, he waited on the Massachusetts Committee of Safety,
      and proposed the same scheme, explaining its practicability, portraying in
      vivid colors the advantages that would result from it, and offering to
      take the lead of the enterprise, if they would invest him with proper
      authority, and furnish the means. The committee eagerly embraced his
      proposal, and on the 3d of May commissioned Benedict Arnold as a colonel
      in the service of Massachusetts, and commander-in-chief of a body of
      troops not to exceed four hundred, with whom he was to proceed on an
      expedition to subdue and take Fort Ticonderoga. The men were to be
      enlisted for this purpose in the western parts of Massachusetts, and the
      other colonies bordering on those parts. The Colonel was moreover
      instructed, after taking possession of Ticonderoga, to leave a small
      garrison there sufficient for its defence, and to bring to Cambridge such
      of the cannon, mortars, and stores, as he should judge would be
      serviceable to the army. In the siege of Boston, now begun by the
      Provincial forces, the cannon and mortars were extremely wanted, and the
      hope of obtaining them was a principal motive with the Committee for
      favoring the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a vote of the Committee of Safety, the Provincial Congress of
      Massachusetts was likewise desired to supply Colonel Arnold with one
      hundred pounds in cash, two hundred pounds' weight of gun-powder, the same
      quantity of leaden balls, one thousand flints, and ten horses, for the use
      of the colony. He was authorized to procure stores and provisions for his
      troops, and to draw on the Committee for the sums expended in the purchase
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temperament of Colonel Arnold admitted no delay after matters had been
      thus arranged, and he made all haste to the theatre of operations. He
      arrived at Stockbridge, on the frontier of Massachusetts, within three
      days of the time of receiving his commission. To his great disappointment
      he there ascertained, that a party of men from Connecticut had already
      gone forward, with the design of raising the Green Mountain Boys, and
      making an assault upon the fortress. The laurels, which he had gathered in
      anticipation, seemed now to be escaping from his grasp, and he waited not
      a moment longer on the way than was requisite to engage a few officers to
      enlist troops and follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small party of men from Connecticut, and another from Berkshire County
      under Colonel Easton, had proceeded to Bennington, and joined themselves
      to Ethan Allen at the head of a still larger number of his mountaineers.
      They had all marched towards Lake Champlain. Arnold overtook them at
      Castleton, about twenty-five miles from Ticonderoga. A council of war had
      just been held, in which the command of the combined forces was assigned
      to Colonel Ethan Allen, and a plan of operations was fully agreed upon.
      All things were in readiness for pushing forward the next morning. At this
      juncture Arnold made his appearance, introduced himself to the officers,
      drew his commission from his pocket, and in virtue of it claimed the
      command of the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bold assurance in a person, with whom the troops were not acquainted,
      who had taken no part in calling them together, and who pretended to act
      under an authority, which none of them recognised, was received with equal
      astonishment and indignation. Arnold had come accompanied by one attendant
      only. It is true, there was a small body of volunteers from Massachusetts
      in the party; but these had turned out under Colonel Easton, at the
      request of the committee from Connecticut, who superintended the
      expedition, and by whom all the troops were to be paid. The Green Mountain
      Boys constituted much the larger portion of the whole number, and they
      were too warmly attached to their officers, and particularly to their
      chivalrous leader and early champion, Ethan Allen, to be prevailed upon to
      move a step further if Arnold's pretensions were allowed. Confusion and
      symptoms of mutiny among the men ensued, and seemed to threaten a defeat
      of the enterprise. For once the discretion of Arnold got the better of his
      ambition, and he yielded to a necessity, which he could not control. He
      assented to a compromise, and agreed to join the party as a volunteer,
      maintaining his rank but exercising no command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harmony being restored, the party advanced to Ticonderoga, took the fort
      by surprise on the morning of the 10th of May, and made the whole garrison
      prisoners. Ethan Allen, as the commander, entered the fort at the head of
      his men. Arnold, ever foremost in scenes of danger and feats of courage,
      assumed the privilege of passing through the gate at his left hand. Thus
      the love of glory, common to them both, was gratified; and the pride of
      Arnold was soothed, after the wound it had received by the disappointment
      of his ambitious hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon appeared, however, that the aims of so aspiring and restless a
      spirit were not to be easily frustrated, and that the conciliatory
      acquiescence at Castleton was no more than the evidence of a truce, and
      not the pledge of a permanent peace. A few hours after the surrender of
      the garrison, Arnold again insisted on taking the command of the post and
      all the troops, affirming that no other person present was vested with an
      authority equal to that conferred by his commission. To prevent these
      fresh seeds of dissension from taking root, the committee from Connecticut
      interfered, and by a formal written instrument appointed Colonel Allen
      commandant of Ticonderoga and its dependencies, till further orders should
      be received from the colony of Connecticut or the Continental Congress.
      Unsustained by a single voice, and deeming it an idle show of power to
      issue orders, which no one would obey, Arnold again made a virtue of
      necessity by submission, contenting himself with a protest, and with
      sending a catalogue of his grievances to the legislature of Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not in his nature to be idle. Four days after the capture of
      the fortress, about fifty men, who had been enlisted in compliance with
      the orders given by him on the road, joined him with two captains at
      Ticonderoga. These were properly under his command. They came by the way
      of Skenesborough, and brought forward the schooner taken at that place,
      which belonged to Major Skene. He manned this vessel, proceeded
      immediately down the Lake to St. John's, where he surprised the garrison,
      taking a sergeant and twelve men prisoners, and captured a King's sloop
      with seven men. After destroying five batteaux, seizing four others, and
      putting on board some of the valuable stores from the fort, he returned to
      Ticonderoga. Colonel Allen went upon the same expedition with one hundred
      and fifty men in batteaux from Crown Point, but, as the batteaux moved
      with less speed than the schooner, he met Arnold returning about fifteen
      miles from St. John's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, within the space of eight days, the once formidable posts of
      Ticonderoga and Crown Point, renowned in former wars, with all their
      dependencies on Lake Champlain, fell into the hands of the Americans. A
      reinforcement of more than four hundred British and Canadians very shortly
      afterwards arrived at St. John's, and it was rumored that water-craft
      would be brought from Montreal and Chamblee, and an expedition would
      proceed up the Lake to attack the forts. This gave Arnold an opportunity
      of separating from Allen. Having some experience in seamanship, he chose
      to consider himself the commander of the navy on the Lake, consisting of
      Major Skene's schooner, the King's sloop, and a small flotilla of
      batteaux. With these he left Ticonderoga and took post at Crown Point,
      resolved there to make a stand and meet the enemy whenever they should
      approach. The number of his men was now increased to about one hundred and
      fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first care was to arm his vessels, having previously commissioned a
      captain for each. In the sloop he fixed six carriage guns and twelve
      swivels, and in the schooner four carriage guns and eight swivels. In
      compliance with the orders of the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, which
      accompanied his commission, he likewise busied himself in sending off some
      of the cannon and mortars from Crown Point, with the intention that they
      should be transported by way of Lake George to the army at Cambridge.
      Abundant supplies of pork and flour were received from Albany, collected
      and sent forward by the committee of that town.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things were in train, letters were written and messages
      despatched from Ticonderoga to the legislatures of Massachusetts and
      Connecticut. Full details of all the proceedings were communicated, in
      which the conduct of Arnold was set forth in no favorable light. A man's
      enemies seldom have the acuteness to discover his merits, or the charity
      to overlook his faults, and are as little disposed to proclaim the former
      as to conceal the latter. Arnold's presumption and arrogance were themes
      of censure; his zeal and energy in contributing to effect the main objects
      of the expedition were passed over unnoticed. These representations by
      degrees impaired the confidence of the Massachusetts legislature in their
      colonel, and caused them to regard with indifference his complaints and
      demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason, also, operated to the same end. When it was known that
      Connecticut had gone foremost in the enterprise, and when the doubtful
      issue of so bold a step was more calmly considered, the government of
      Massachusetts seemed not reluctant to relinquish both the honor and charge
      of maintaining the conquered posts. It was finally agreed between the
      parties, and approved by the Continental Congress, that Connecticut should
      send up troops, and an officer to take the general command, and that such
      forces as were on the spot from Massachusetts, or as might afterwards be
      enlisted for that service, should be under the same officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold sent a messenger to Montreal and Caghnawaga, for the purpose of
      ascertaining the designs of the Canadians and Indians, and the actual
      force of General Carleton. About the middle of June he wrote to the
      Continental Congress, communicating all the facts he had obtained, and
      expressing a conviction that the whole of Canada might be taken with two
      thousand men. He even proposed a general plan of operations, and offered
      to head the expedition and be responsible for consequences. It seems he
      was personally acquainted with the country, and had several friends in
      Montreal and Quebec, which places he had probably visited in prosecuting
      his mercantile affairs. Certain persons in Montreal, he said, had agreed
      to open the gates, as soon as an American force should appear before the
      city; and he added, that General Carleton had under his command only five
      hundred and fifty effective men, who were scattered at different posts.
      Such were his representations, and they were, doubtless, nearly accurate;
      but Congress were not yet prepared to second his views or approve his
      counsels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the legislature of Massachusetts delegated three of their
      number as a committee to proceed to Lake Champlain, and inquire into the
      state of affairs in that quarter. The members of this committee were
      instructed to ascertain in what manner Colonel Arnold had executed his
      commission, and, after acquainting themselves with his "spirit, capacity,
      and conduct," they were authorized, should they think proper, to order his
      immediate return to Massachusetts, that he might render an account of the
      money, ammunition, and stores, which he had received, and of the debts he
      had contracted in behalf of the colony. If he remained, he was in any
      event to be subordinate to Colonel Hinman, the commanding officer from
      Connecticut. The committee were likewise empowered to regulate other
      matters, relating to the supplies and arrangements of the Massachusetts
      troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Colonel Arnold at Crown Point, acting in the double capacity of
      commandant of the fortress and admiral of his little fleet, consisting of
      the armed sloop, schooner, and batteaux, which he had contrived to keep
      together at that place. At his request, they laid before him a copy of
      their instructions. It may easily be imagined in what manner these would
      affect such a temperament as that of Arnold. He was exceedingly indignant,
      and complained of being treated with injustice and disrespect, in which he
      was perhaps not entirely in the wrong. He said that he had omitted no
      efforts to comply with the intentions of the Committee of Safety,
      signified in their commission to him; that an order to inquire into his
      conduct, when no charge had been exhibited against him, was unprecedented;
      that the assumption to judge of his capacity and spirit was an indignity;
      that this point ought to have been decided before they honored him with
      their confidence; that he had already paid out of his own pocket for the
      public service more than one hundred pounds, and contracted debts on his
      personal credit in procuring necessaries for the army, which he was bound
      to pay, or leave the post with dishonor; and finally, that he would not
      submit to the degradation of being superseded by a junior officer. After
      he had thus enumerated his grievances, and his warmth had a little
      subsided, he wrote to the committee a formal letter of resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next discharged the men, who were engaged to serve under him, which was
      a signal for a new scene of difficulties. Some of them, who had become
      attached to their leader, espoused his cause, and gave tokens of
      dissatisfaction, which it may be presumed he would not strive either by
      persuasion or authority to pacify. The pay of all the troops was in
      arrears, and the rumor went abroad, that, since the colonel had resigned
      and the troops were disbanded, their claims would not be received by the
      government. They began to be turbulent and mutinous; but the committee at
      last succeeded in quieting them, by assurances that every man should be
      paid, and by embodying under Colonel Easton all such as chose to reenlist.

    </p>
    <p>
      Having nothing more to do on the frontiers. Arnold made haste back to
      Cambridge, where he arrived early in July, uttering audible murmurs of
      discontent, and complaints of ill treatment against the legislature of
      Massachusetts. His accounts were allowed and settled, although, if we may
      judge from the journals, some of his drafts presented from time to time by
      the holders were met with a reluctance, which indicated doubt and
      suspicion.

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <i>Expedition through the Wilderness to Quebec.</i>
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>rnold was now
      unemployed, but a project was soon set on foot suited to his genius and
      capacity. General Washington had taken command of the army at Cambridge.
      The Continental Congress had resolved that an incursion into Canada should
      be made by the troops under General Schuyler. To facilitate this object, a
      plan was devised about the middle of August, by the Commander-in-chief and
      several members of Congress then on a visit to the army during an
      adjournment of that body, to send an expedition to Quebec through the
      eastern wilderness, by way of the Kennebec River, which should eventually
      cooperate with the other party, or cause a diversion of the enemy, that
      would be favorable to its movements. Arnold was selected to be the
      conductor of this expedition, and he received from Washington a commission
      of colonel in the Continental service. The enterprise was bold and
      perilous, encompassed with untried difficulties, and not less hazardous in
      its execution, than uncertain as to its results. These features, repelling
      as they were in themselves, appeared attractive in the eyes of a man,
      whose aliment was glory, and whose spirit was sanguine, restless, and
      daring. About eleven hundred effective men were detached and put under his
      command, being ten companies of musketmen from New England, and three
      companies of riflemen from Virginia and Pennsylvania. The field-officers,
      in addition to the chief, were Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Greene,
      afterwards the hero of Red Bank, Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Enos, and Majors
      Bigelow and Meigs. At the head of the riflemen was Captain Daniel Morgan,
      renowned in the subsequent annals of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      These troops marched from Cambridge to Newburyport, where they embarked on
      board eleven transports, September 18th, and sailed the next day for the
      Kennebec River. Three small boats were previously despatched down the
      coast, to ascertain if any of the enemy's ships of war or cruisers were in
      sight. At the end of two days after leaving Newbury port, all the
      transports had entered the Kennebec, and sailed up the river to the town
      of Gardiner, without any material accident. Two or three of them had
      grounded in shoal water, but they were got off uninjured. A company of
      carpenters had been sent from Cambridge, several days before the
      detachment left that place, with orders to construct two hundred batteaux
      at Pittston, on the bank of the river opposite to Gardiner. These were now
      in readiness, and the men and provisions were transferred to them from the
      shipping. They all rendezvoused a few miles higher up the river at Fort
      Western, opposite to the present town of Augusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the hard struggles, sufferings, and dangers were to begin. Eleven
      hundred men, with arms, ammunition, and all the apparatus of war,
      burthened with the provisions for their sustenance and clothing to protect
      them from the inclemencies of the weather, were to pass through a region
      uninhabited, wild, and desolate, forcing their batteaux against a swift
      current, and carrying them and their contents on their own shoulders
      around rapids and cataracts, over craggy precipices, and through morasses,
      till they should reach the French settlements on the Canada frontiers, a
      distance of more than two hundred miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander was not ignorant of the obstacles with which he had to
      contend. Colonel Montresor, an officer in the British army, had passed
      over the same route fifteen years before, and written a journal of his
      tour, an imperfect copy of which had fallen into the hands of Arnold. The
      remarks of Montresor afforded valuable hints. He came from Quebec,
      ascending the Rivers Chaudière and Des Loups, crossing the highlands near
      the head-waters of the Penobscot, pursuing his way through Moosehead Lake,
      and entering the Kennebec by its eastern branch. He returned up the
      western branch, or Dead River, and through Lake Megantic into the
      Chaudière. This latter route was to be pursued by the expedition.
      Intelligence had likewise been derived from several St. Francis Indians,
      who had recently visited Washington's camp, and who were familiar with
      these interior regions. Two persons had been secretly despatched towards
      Quebec as an exploring party, from whom Arnold received a communication at
      Fort Western. They had proceeded no farther than the headwaters of the
      Dead River, being deterred by the extravagant tales of Natanis, called
      "the last of the Norridgewocks," who had a cabin in that quarter, and who
      was then probably in the interest of the enemy, though he joined the
      Americans in their march. Colonel Arnold had moreover been furnished with
      a manuscript map and a journal by Mr. Samuel Goodwin of Pownalborough, who
      had been a resident and surveyor in the Kennebec country for twenty-five
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these sources of information Colonel Arnold was as well prepared, as
      the nature of the case would admit, for the arduous task before him. While
      the preparations were making at Fort Western for the departure of the
      army, a small reconnoitring party of six or seven men was sent forward in
      two birch canoes under the command of Lieutenant Steel, with orders to go
      as far as Lake Megantic, or Chaudière Pond as it was sometimes called, and
      procure such intelligence as they could from the Indians, who were said to
      be in that neighborhood on a hunting excursion; and also Lieutenant Church
      with another party of seven men, a surveyor, and guide, to take the exact
      courses and distances of the Dead River. Next the army began to move in
      four divisions, each setting off a day before the other, and thus allowing
      sufficient space between them to prevent any interference in passing up
      the rapids and around the falls. Morgan went ahead with the riflemen; then
      came Greene and Bigelow with three companies of musketeers; these were
      followed by Meigs with four others; and last of all was Enos, who brought
      up the rear with the three remaining companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen all the troops embarked, Arnold followed them in a birch
      canoe, and pushing forward he passed the whole line at different points,
      overtaking Morgan's advanced party the third day at Norridgewock Falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a short distance below these falls, on the eastern bank of the river,
      was a wide and beautiful plain, once the site of an Indian village,
      belonging to a tribe from whom the falls took their name, and memorable in
      the annals of former days as the theatre of a tragical event, in which
      many of the tribe were slain in a sudden attack, and among them Father
      Ralle, the venerable and learned missionary, who had dwelt there
      twenty-six years. The foundations of a church and of an altar in ruins
      were still visible, the only remaining memorials of a people, whose name
      was once feared, and of a man who exiled himself from all the enjoyments
      of civilization to plant the cross in a savage wilderness, and who lost
      his life in its defence. Let history tell the story as it may, and let it
      assign such motives as it may for the conduct of the assailants, the heart
      of him is little to be envied, who can behold unmoved these melancholy
      vestiges of a race extinct, or pass by the grave of Ralle without a tear
      of sympathy or a sigh of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must not detain the reader upon a theme so foreign from the purpose
      of our narrative. Justice claimed the tribute of this brief record. At the
      Norridgewock Falls was a portage, where all the batteaux were to be taken
      out of the river and transported a mile and a quarter by land. The task
      was slow and fatiguing. The banks on each side were uneven and rocky. It
      was found that much of the provisions, particularly the bread, was
      damaged. The boats had been imperfectly made, and were leaky: the men were
      unskilled in navigating them, and divers accidents had happened in
      ascending the rapids. The carpenters were set to work in repairing the
      most defective boats. This caused a detention, and seven days were
      expended in getting the whole line of the army around the falls. As soon
      as the last batteau was launched in the waters above, Arnold betook
      himself again to his birch canoe with his Indian guide, quickly shot ahead
      of the rear division, passed the portage at the Carratunc Falls, and in
      two days arrived at the Great Carrying-place, twelve miles below the
      junction of the Dead River with the eastern branch of the Kennebec. Here
      he found the two first divisions of the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far the expedition had proceeded as successfully as could have been
      anticipated. The fatigue was extreme, yet one man only had been lost by
      death. There seem to have been desertions and sickness, as the whole
      number now amounted to no more than nine hundred and fifty effective men.
      They had passed four portages, assisted by oxen and sleds where the
      situation of the ground would permit. So rapid was the stream, that on an
      average the men waded more than half the way, forcing the batteaux against
      the current. Arnold wrote, in a letter to General Washington, "You would
      have taken the men for amphibious animals, as they were great part of the
      time under water." He had now twenty-five days' provisions for the whole
      detachment, and expressed a sanguine hope of reaching the Chaudière River
      in eight or ten days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this hope he was destined to be disappointed. Obstacles increased in
      number and magnitude as he advanced, which it required all his resources
      and energy to overcome. The Great Carrying-place extended from the
      Kennebec to the Dead River, being a space of fifteen miles, with three
      small ponds intervening. From this place the batteaux, provisions, and
      baggage were to be carried over the portages on the men's shoulders. With
      incredible toil they were taken from the waters of the Kennebec, and
      transported along an ascending, rugged, and precipitous path for more than
      three miles to the first pond. Here the batteaux were again put afloat;
      and thus they continued by alternate water and land carriage, through
      lakes, creeks, morasses, and craggy ravines, till they reached the Dead
      River.
    </p>
    <p>
      As some relief to their sufferings, the men were regaled by feasting on
      delicious salmon-trout, which the ponds afforded in prodigious quantities.
      Two oxen were also slaughtered and divided among them. A block-house was
      built at the second portage, at which the sick were left; and another near
      the bank of the Kennebec, as a depository for provisions ordered up from
      the commissary at Norridgewock, and intended as a supply in case a retreat
      should be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the army was crossing the Great Carrying-place, Arnold despatched
      two Indians with letters to gentlemen in Quebec and to General Schuyler.
      They were accompanied by a white man, named Jakins, who was to proceed
      down the Chaudière to the French settlements, ascertain the sentiments of
      the inhabitants, procure intelligence, and then return. It appeared
      afterwards, that the Indians betrayed their trust. The letters never
      reached the persons to whom they were addressed, but were doubtless put
      into the hands of the Lieutenant-Governor of Canada. The Indian, who had
      them in charge, named Eneas, was afterwards known to be in Quebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dead River presented for many miles a smooth surface and gentle
      current, interrupted here and there by falls of short descent, at which
      were carrying-places. As the batteaux were moving along this placid
      stream, a bold and lofty mountain appeared in the distance, whose summit
      was whitened with snow. When approached, the river was discovered to
      pursue a very meandering course near its base; and, although the fatigue
      of the men was less severe than it had been, yet their actual progress was
      slow. In the vicinity of this mountain Arnold encamped for two or three
      days, and, as report says, raised the American flag over his tent. The
      event has been commemorated. A hamlet since planted on the spot, which ere
      long will swell to the dignity of a town, is at this day called the Flag
      Staff. The mountain has been equally honored. Tradition has told the
      pioneers of the forest, and repeated the marvel till it is believed, that
      Major Bigelow had the courage as well as the leisure to ascend to its top,
      with the hope of discovering from this lofty eminence the hills of Canada
      and the spires of Quebec. From this supposed adventure it has received the
      name of Mount Bigelow. Its towering peaks, looking down upon the
      surrounding mountains, are a beacon to the trappers and hunters, who still
      follow their vocation in these solitudes, notwithstanding the once-coveted
      beaver has fled from their domain, and the field of their enterprise has
      been ominously contracted by the encroaching tide of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this encampment a party of ninety men was sent back to the rear for
      provisions, which were beginning to grow scarce. Morgan with his riflemen
      had gone forward, and Arnold followed with the second division. For three
      days it rained incessantly, and every man and all the baggage were
      drenched with water. One night, after they had landed at a late hour and
      were endeavouring to take a little repose, they were suddenly roused by
      the freshet, which came rushing upon them in a torrent, and hardly allowed
      them time to escape, before the ground on which they had lain down was
      overflowed. In nine hours the river rose perpendicularly eight feet.
      Embarrassments thickened at every step. The current was everywhere rapid;
      the stream had spread itself over the low grounds by the increase of its
      waters, thereby exposing the batteaux to be perpetually entangled in the
      drift-wood and bushes; sometimes they were led away from the main stream
      into smaller branches and obliged to retrace their course, and at others
      delayed by portages, which became more frequent as they advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a disaster happened, which was near putting an end to the
      expedition. By the turbulence of the waters seven batteaux were overset,
      and all their contents lost. This made such a breach upon the provisions,
      and threw such a gloom over the future, that the bravest among them was
      almost ready to despond. They were now thirty miles from the head of the
      Chaudière River. It was ascertained, that the provisions remaining would
      serve for twelve or fifteen days. A council of war was called, at which it
      was decided that the sick and feeble should be sent back, and the others
      press forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold wrote to Colonel Greene and Colonel Enos, who were in the rear,
      ordering them to select such a number of their strongest men as they could
      supply with fifteen days' provisions, and to come on with them, leaving
      the others to return to Norridgewock. Enos misconstrued the order, or
      chose not to understand it. He retreated with his whole division,
      consisting of three companies, and marched back to Cambridge. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * Colonel Enos was tried by a court-martial, after his arrival at
      head-quarters, and acquitted on the ground of a want of provisions. But
      the true state of the case was not understood, as no intelligence on the
      subject had been received from Arnold. The trial was hastened, because
      Enos's commission in the army, as first organized, would expire at the end
      of the year, and it was supposed he could not be tried under his new
      commission. He certainly disobeyed the order of his commander, nor was the
      plea of a deficiency of provisions admissible. The same quantity of
      provisions, that would be consumed by three companies in returning to the
      settlements on the Kennebec, would have served part of them for that
      purpose, and another part for fifteen days in marching to the Chaudière.
      He was ordered to divide his men in such a manner as to accomplish both
      these objects. Although acquitted by the court-martial, he either
      imagined, or had the sagacity to perceive, that his conduct was not
      satisfactory to General Washington, and soon left the army.&mdash;See
      Washington's Writings, Vol. III. p. 164.
    </p>
    <p>
      After despatching this order, Arnold hastened onward with about sixty men
      under Captain Hanchet, intending to proceed as soon as possible to the
      inhabitants on the Chaudière, and send back provisions to meet the main
      forces. The rain changed into snow, which fell two inches deep, thus
      adding the sufferings of cold to those of hunger and fatigue. Ice formed
      on the surface of the water in which the men were obliged to wade and drag
      the boats. Finally the highlands were reached, which separated the eastern
      waters from those of the St. Lawrence. A string of small lakes, choked
      with logs and other obstructions, had been passed through near the sources
      of the Dead River, and seventeen falls had been encountered in ascending
      its whole distance, around which were portages. The carrying-place over
      the highlands was a little more than four miles. A small stream then
      presented itself, which conducted the boats by a very crooked course into
      Lake Megantic, the great fountainhead of the Chaudière River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here were found Lieutenants Steel and Church, who had been sent forward a
      second time from the Great Carrying-place with a party of men to explore
      and clear paths at the portages. Here also was Jakins, returned from the
      settlements, who made a favorable report in regard to the sentiments of
      the people, saying they were friendly and rejoiced at the approach of the
      army. Lake Megantic is thirteen miles long and three or four broad, and
      surrounded by high mountains. The night after entering it, the party
      encamped on its eastern shore, where was a large Indian wigwam, that
      contributed to the comfort of their quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning Arnold despatched a person to the rear of the army,
      with instructions to the advancing troops. He then ordered Captain Hanchet
      and fifty-five men to march by land along the margin of the lake, and
      himself embarked with Captain Oswald, and Lieutenants Steel and Church
      with thirteen men in five batteaux and a birch canoe, resolved to proceed
      as soon as possible to the French inhabitants, and send back provisions to
      meet the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three hours they reached the northern extremity of the lake, and
      entered the Chaudière, which carried them along with prodigious rapidity
      on its tide of waters boiling and foaming over a rocky bottom. The baggage
      was lashed to the boats, and the danger was doubly threatening, as they
      had no guides. At length they fell among rapids; three of the boats were
      overset, dashed to pieces against the rocks, and all their contents
      swallowed up by the waves. Happily no lives were lost, although six men
      struggled for some time in the water, and were saved with difficulty. This
      misfortune, calamitous as it was, Arnold ascribes in his Journal to a
      "kind interposition of Providence"; for no sooner had the men dried their
      clothes and reembarked, than one of them who had gone forward cried out,
      "A fall ahead," which had not been discovered, and over which the whole
      party must have been hurried to inevitable destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say, that after this experience they were more cautious.
      Rapids and falls succeeded each other at short intervals. The birch canoe
      met the fate of the three batteaux, by running upon the rocks. Sometimes
      the boats were retarded in their velocity by ropes extended from the stem
      to the bank of the river. Two Penobscot Indians assisted them over a
      portage of more than half a mile in length. Through its whole extent the
      stream, raised by the late rains, was rough, rapid, and dangerous; but the
      party was fortunate in losing no lives and in advancing quickly. On the
      third day after leaving Lake Megantic, being the 30th of October, Arnold
      arrived at Sertigan, the first French settlement, four miles below the
      junction of the River Des Loups with the Chaudière, and seventy miles from
      the lake by the course of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first care was to relieve his suffering troops, some of whom were
      already fainting with hunger, exhausted with fatigue, and overcome with
      toils and privations, to which they had never been accustomed. * He
      immediately sent back several Canadians and Indians with flour and cattle,
      who met the troops marching through the woods near the bank of the river,
      all their boats having been destroyed by the violence of the rapids. The
      whole army arrived within four or five days, emerging from the forests in
      small and detached parties, and greeting once more with joy unspeakable
      the habitations of civilized men. They were received in a friendly manner
      by the inhabitants, who supplied their wants with hospitable abundance,
      and seemed favorably inclined to the objects of the expedition, not being
      yet heartily reconciled to the burden of a foreign yoke, however light in
      itself, which the adverse fortunes of war had doomed them to wear since
      the brilliant victory of Wolfe on the Heights of Abraham.
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * So extreme was the famine for the last three or four days of the march,
      that dogs were killed and greedily devoured. This fact was stated by
      General Dearborn, who had been a captain in the expedition, in a letter to
      President Allen of Bowdoin College. Moose-skin moccasins were boiled to
      procure from them such nourishment as they afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Arnold proceeded down the river to conciliate the attachment of
      the people, and make further preparations for the march of his army.
      Before leaving Cambridge, he had received ample instructions for the
      regulation of his conduct, drawn up with care and forethought by the
      Commander-in-chief, and containing express orders to treat the Canadians
      on all occasions as friends, to avoid every thing that should give offence
      or excite suspicion, to respect their religious ceremonies and national
      habits, to pay them liberally and promptly for supplies and assistance, to
      punish with severity any improper acts of the soldiery; in a word, to
      convince them that their interests were involved in the results of the
      expedition, and that its ultimate purpose was to protect their civil
      liberties and the rights of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was also furnished with printed copies of a manifesto, signed by
      General Washington, intended for distribution among the people, explaining
      the grounds of the contest between Great Britain and America, and
      encouraging them to join their neighbors in a common cause by rallying
      around the standard of liberty. These instructions were strictly observed
      by the American troops, and had their desired influence. The impression
      was lasting. To this day the old men recount to their children the story
      of the "descent of the Bostonians," as the only great public event that
      has ever occurred to vary the monotonous incidents of the sequestered and
      beautiful valley of the Chaudière.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days after reaching the upper settlements, Arnold arrived at Point
      Levy opposite to Quebec. His troops followed, and were all with him at
      that place on the 13th of November. About forty Indians had joined him at
      Sertigan and on the march below. He had ascertained that his approach was
      known in Quebec, and that all the boats had been withdrawn from the
      eastern side of the St. Lawrence to deprive him of the means of crossing.
      Eneas, the savage whom he had sent with a letter to General Schuyler, and
      another to a friend in Quebec, had found his way to the enemy, and given
      up his despatches to some of the King's officers. He pretended to have
      been taken prisoner; but treachery and falsehood are so nearly allied,
      that Eneas had the credit of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between thirty and forty birch canoes having been collected, Arnold
      resolved to make an immediate attempt to cross the river. The first
      division left Point Levy at nine o'clock in the evening and landed safely
      on the other side, having eluded a frigate and sloop stationed in the St.
      Lawrence on purpose to intercept them. The canoes returned, and by four in
      the morning five hundred men had passed over at three separate times, and
      rendezvoused at Wolfe's Cove. Just as the last party landed, they were
      discovered by one of the enemy's guard-boats, into which they fired and
      killed three men. It was not safe to return again, and about one hundred
      and fifty men were left at Point Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      No time was now to be lost. Headed by their leader they clambered up the
      precipice at the same place, where Wolfe sixteen years before had
      conducted his army to the field of carnage and of victory. When the day
      dawned, this resolute band of Americans, few in number compared with the
      hosts of the British hero, but not less determined in purpose or strong in
      spirit, stood on the Plains of Abraham, with the walls of Quebec full in
      their view. They were now on the spot, to which their eager wishes had
      tended from the moment they left the camp of Washington; and, after
      encountering so many perils and enduring such extremities of toil, cold,
      and hunger with unparalleled fortitude, it was a mortifying reflection,
      that scarcely a glimmering hope of success remained. Troops had recently
      come to Quebec from Sorel and Newfoundland, and such preparations for
      defence had been made, that it would have been madness to attempt a
      serious assault of the town with so small a force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strength of the garrison, including regulars and militia within the
      walls, and the mariners and sailors on board the ships, was little short
      of eighteen hundred men. But two thirds of these were militia, many of
      whom were Canadians supposed to be friendly to the Americans, and ready to
      join with them whenever they should enter the town. This expectation,
      indeed, had been one of the chief encouragements for undertaking the
      enterprise against Quebec. To make an experiment upon the temper of the
      inhabitants, Arnold drew up his men within eight hundred yards of the
      walls, and gave three cheers, hoping by this display to bring out the
      regulars to an open action on the plain. The gates would thus be unclosed,
      and, if the people in the town were as favorably disposed as had been
      represented, there might thus be an opportunity of forming a junction and
      acting in concert, as circumstances should dictate. This has been
      considered as a ridiculous and unmeaning parade on the part of the
      American commander, but he doubtless had some good grounds for the
      manouvre from the intelligence brought to him by persons, whose wishes
      corresponded with his own. At any rate, the garrison chose not to accept
      the challenge in any other manner, than by discharges of cannon through
      the embrasures on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      A specimen of military etiquette, which was next resorted to, may be
      looked upon in a more questionable light. By the rules of war it is
      customary, when a town is about to be stormed, for the assailing party to
      send in a summons demanding a surrender and proffering conditions. That
      every thing might be done in due form, Arnold wrote a letter to
      Lieutenant-Governor Cramahé, the British commander in Quebec, calling on
      him in the name of the American Congress to give up the city, and
      threatening him with disastrous consequences, if the surrender should be
      delayed. This idle piece of formality might have been spared; it could
      only excite the derision of the enemy, who knew the precise strength of
      the assailants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Canadians, however, and particularly the people in the surrounding
      country, were much alarmed. The phenomenon of an army descending from a
      wilderness, which had hitherto been considered impassable, except by very
      small parties with light birch canoes, easily transported over the
      portages, filled them with wonder and apprehension. Report had magnified
      the number of the invaders, and the imagination gave ready credence to the
      tales that were told of the prowess and valor of men, who had performed a
      feat so daring in its attempt, and extraordinary in its success. It was
      even said, that these men were cased in iron, and that their power of body
      was equal to their courage and fortitude. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * This idea gained currency from the curious circumstance of mistaking the
      sound of a word. Morgan's riflemen were clothed in linen frocks, the
      common uniform of that description of troops. When they first appeared
      emerging from the woods, the Canadians said they were vêtus en toile; but,
      as the intelligence spread, the word toile, linen, was changed into tôle,
      sheet-iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fears were of short duration. The reality was soon made manifest,
      and Arnold himself was the first to discover his weakness and danger.
      Three days after his formidable summons, he had leisure to examine into
      the state of the arms and ammunition of his troops, and to his surprise he
      found almost all the cartridges spoiled, there being not more than five
      rounds to a man, and nearly one hundred muskets unfit for use. Some of the
      men were invalids, and many deficient in clothing and other necessaries.
      At the same time he received advice from his friends in town, that a
      sortie was about to be made with a force considerably superior to his own.
      A retreat was the only expedient that remained. The men left at Point Levy
      had already crossed the river and joined him, and with his whole force he
      marched up the St. Lawrence to Point-aux-Trembles, eight leagues from
      Quebec, intending to wait there the approach of General Montgomery from
      Montreal.

    <h3>
      <i>Operations in Canada.&mdash;Affair of the Cedars.&mdash;Retreat from
      Montreal.</i>
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the same day
      that Arnold made this retreat, Governor Carleton arrived at Quebec. He had
      escaped in the night from the British fleet, which was stopped by the
      American batteries at Sorel, and thence passed in a small armed vessel
      down the river. By an official return at Point-aux-Trembles, the entire
      force of the detachment, officers and privates, consisted of six hundred
      and seventy-five men, being somewhat more than half the number that
      marched from Cambridge. Arnold despatched a messenger to General
      Montgomery, then at Montreal, describing his necessitous condition for
      want of clothing, and a full supply was immediately forwarded to him. By
      the capture of the small fleet at Sorel under General Prescott, the
      Americans had gained command of the river above Quebec; and as all the
      British posts in Canada had been taken, except the capital, this was now
      the grand object to be attained. Montgomery made all haste to join Arnold
      for that purpose; and, leaving a small garrison at Montreal, he embarked
      about three hundred men, several mortars, and Captain Lamb's company of
      artillery, on board some of the armed vessels taken at Sorel, and went
      down the river to Point-aux-Trembles. The command now devolved on General
      Montgomery, and the two detachments marched immediately to the Heights of
      Abraham, where they arrived on the 4th of December. Although the effective
      force of the Americans was less than a thousand men, and the number
      bearing arms in the city, including British, militia, and Canadians,
      amounted to eighteen hundred, yet it was resolved to hazard an assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Arnold had written to General Washington from Point-aux-Trembles,
      that it would require twenty-five hundred men to reduce Quebec. Calmly
      viewed through the medium of historical evidence, with a full knowledge of
      collateral facts and subsequent events, a resolution for an immediate
      assault may now seem rash and ill advised. But General Montgomery relied
      on the lukewarmness of the inhabitants, and their readiness to abandon the
      British standard whenever they should see a reasonable hope of protection
      from the assailants. He likewise believed, that the large extent of the
      works rendered them incapable of being defended at all points, and that in
      this respect the seeming strength of the enemy was in reality an element
      of weakness. He moreover derived a renovated confidence from the
      disposition of his officers and troops, who seconded with promptness and
      zeal the views of their leader. Notwithstanding the weight of these
      motives, and of others that might have had their influence, it must ever
      be lamented, that a spirit so elevated and generous, fraught with the
      noblest principles of honor and chivalrous feeling, was doomed to be
      sacrificed in a conflict so utterly unequal and hopeless of success.
      Leonidas died not a braver death, nor with a self-devotion more worthy to
      place him among the first of heroes and of patriots.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are not now concerned with the history of events, any farther than
      to sketch very briefly the part acted in them by the subject of the
      present narrative. General Montgomery found Arnold, as he said, "active,
      intelligent, and enterprising." A quarrel happened between Arnold and one
      of his captains, which drew three companies into a mutinous combination;
      but the danger was checked by the decision and firmness of the commander,
      who discovered the captain to be in the wrong, and maintained
      subordination. Several attempts were made to send a summons into the town;
      but Governor Carleton forbade all communication, and no flag was suffered
      to approach the walls. Meantime preparations for an attack were carried
      on. A battery was opened, from which five cannon and a howitzer were
      brought to bear upon the town, but with very little effect. There were
      slight skirmishes in the suburbs, houses were burnt, and a few men killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different plans of attack had been meditated, and it was at last resolved
      to make a general assault upon the lower town. Montgomery was to proceed
      with one division of the army along the margin of the St. Lawrence around
      the base of Cape Diamond, and Arnold with his detachment by the way of St.
      Roque. Each commander was to act according to circumstances, and both
      parties were to unite if possible at the eastern extremity of the town. At
      five o'clock in the morning of the 31st of December they began their
      march. Arnold had already passed through the suburb of St. Roque, and
      approached unperceived a picketed two-gun battery or barrier across the
      street. It was attacked by Captain Lamb's artillery, but was bravely
      defended for about an hour, when it was carried, and the Americans pushed
      forward in the midst of a violent snow-storm, till they arrived at a
      second barrier. Several lives had been lost at the first barrier. Arnold
      was shot through the leg. The bone was fractured, and he was obliged to be
      taken to the general hospital; where he learned that Montgomery had been
      killed in forcing a barrier at Cape Diamond, and that his troops had
      retreated. A very severe contest was kept up by his own party at the
      second barrier for three hours, without being able to force their way
      beyond it. While yet in the heat of action, they were surrounded by a
      party, that issued from one of the gates of the city in their rear, by
      which their retreat was cut off, and between three and four hundred were
      taken prisoners. The killed and wounded were about sixty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affair being thus unhappily terminated, the command fell again upon
      Colonel Arnold. By an exact return two days after the action, the whole
      number of troops under him was a little short of eight hundred, including
      Colonel Livingston's regiment of Canadians, which amounted to about two
      hundred. With this mere shadow of an army he resolved to maintain a
      blockade of the city, till reinforcements should arrive. The winter had
      now set in with its usual-severity, and a scene of long and dismal
      suffering from cold and privations appeared in prospect. "Many of the
      troops are dejected," he said in a letter to General Wooster, "and anxious
      to get home, and some have actually set off; but I shall endeavour to
      continue the blockade, while there are any hopes of success." Fortunately
      the besieged were nowise inclined to make excursions beyond the walls,
      being contented to wait the opening of spring for a relief from England,
      which might then certainly be expected. Nor was the investiture at any
      time so complete, as not to admit occasional intercourse with the country,
      by which the most pressing want, that of wood, was supplied. Pickets and
      guards, it is true, were stationed in every direction; but, with a force
      so feeble and scattered, little more could be done, than to keep up the
      formality of a blockade. Why the enemy did not sally, and attack the
      American camp, has never been explained. It is probable the governor did
      not think it prudent to put the loyalty of the inhabitants to a test,
      which the contingencies of events might turn to a disadvantage, especially
      as he felt secure in remaining quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the news of the storming of Quebec reached Congress, they
      promoted Arnold to the rank of brigadier-general, as a reward not less of
      his gallant conduct on that occasion, than of his extraordinary enterprise
      and military address in conducting his army through the wilderness.
      Additional troops were likewise immediately ordered to Canada. During the
      winter a few companies, and fragments of companies, from New-Hampshire and
      Massachusetts, and part of Warner's regiment from Vermont, arrived at the
      encampment, having walked on snow-shoes, carried their own provisions, and
      braved all the perils of frost and exposure incident to such a march in so
      rigorous a climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these means the Americans kept their ground, undisturbed by the
      enemy, till spring. Breastworks and fortifications were constructed of
      snow, which, by being rolled into a mass and saturated with water,
      immediately congealed into solid ramparts of ice. The prisoners within the
      city were kindly treated by Governor Carle-ton. He sent out Major Meigs
      for their clothes and baggage, allowed them to be supplied with money and
      other conveniences by their friends, and, after they were released, they
      bore a unanimous testimony to the humanity and good usage extended to them
      by the British commander. The remains of General Montgomery were interred
      with suitable marks of respect. * In a journal kept by an English officer
      during the siege, it is said that ninety-four of the prisoners were
      Europeans, who petitioned in a body to join a regiment of Royal Emigrants
      in the British service.
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * When General Montgomery was killed, he had in his pocket a watch, which
      Mrs. Montgomery was very desirous to obtain. This was made known to
      General Arnold, and he applied to Governor Carleton, offering any price
      for the watch, which he might choose to demand. Carleton immediately sent
      it out, but would suffer nothing to be received in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several of them had deserted, by leaping from the walls and sliding
      down the precipice on the surface of the snow, the remainder were put in
      confinement and retained as prisoners. *

      Smith's History of Canada.

    <p>
      General Wooster had passed the winter at Montreal in a state of repose,
      which his countrymen were not prepared to expect from a man, who had
      gained the reputation of a bold and active officer in the last war. On the
      1st of April he appeared at Quebec, and, being superior in rank, succeeded
      to the command. At this time the number of troops had increased to two
      thousand eight hundred and fifty-five, of whom about eight hundred were
      sick, mostly of the small-pox. A cannonade was opened upon the city from a
      battery of six guns, two howitzers, and two small mortars, on the Heights
      of Abraham, and another of three guns and one howitzer, at Point Levy.
      Preparations were begun for pushing the siege with vigor, but at this time
      an accident happened to General Arnold by the falling of his horse upon
      his wounded leg, which bruised it so badly, that he was laid up for a
      fortnight. He likewise complained of the coldness and reserve of General
      Wooster, who neither asked his advice nor took his counsel; and his temper
      was not formed to brook neglect, nor indeed patiently to act a second
      part. It is moreover to be considered, that he and General Wooster were
      townsmen and neighbors, and with that class of his fellow-citizens he had
      commonly found means to be at points. The condition of his wound was an
      apology for asking leave of absence, which was readily granted, and he
      retired to Montreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here again he was at the head of affairs. Montreal was in the hands of the
      Americans under a military government; and, there being no officer present
      equal to himself in rank, he of course assumed the command. For the first
      six weeks he had little to do; but the catastrophe at the Cedars, in which
      nearly four hundred men surrendered to the enemy by a disgraceful
      capitulation, and a hundred more were killed or taken in a brave
      encounter, called him out to meet the approaching foe, and avenge the
      barbarous murders and other cruelties, which had been committed by the
      savages on the prisoners. He hastened to St. Anne's, at the western part
      of the Island of Montreal, with about eight hundred men, where he arrived
      in the afternoon of the 26th of May. At this moment the enemy's batteaux
      were seen taking the American prisoners from an island about a league
      distant from St. Anne's, and proceeding with them to the main land on the
      opposite side of the St. Lawrence. Arnold's batteaux were still three or
      four miles behind, making their way slowly up the rapids, having fallen in
      the rear of the troops, who marched along the shore. They did not reach
      St. Anne's till nearly sunset. Meantime a small party of Caghnawaga
      Indians returned, whom Arnold had sent over the river in the morning with
      a message to the hostile savages, demanding a surrender of the American
      prisoners, and threatening in case of a refusal, or if any murders were
      committed, that he would sacrifice every Indian that should fall into his
      hands, and follow them to their towns, which he would destroy by fire and
      sword. The Indians sent back an answer by the Caghnawagas, that they had
      five hundred prisoners in their power, and that if Arnold presumed to land
      and attempt a rescue, they would immediately put them all to death, and
      give no quarter to any that should be captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      This threat, however, did not deter Arnold from pursuing his object. He
      filled the boats with his men, and ordered them to row to the island,
      where the prisoners had been confined. He there found five American
      soldiers, naked and almost famished, who informed him that all the other
      prisoners had been taken to Quinze Chiens except two, who, having been
      unwell, were inhumanly butchered. From this island he advanced towards
      Quinze Chiens about four miles below; but, when the boats came within
      three quarters of a mile of the shore, the enemy began to fire upon them
      with two brass field-pieces, and soon afterwards with small arms. The
      boats rowed near the shore, but without returning a shot; and, as it was
      now become dark, and Arnold was unacquainted with the ground, and his men
      were much fatigued, he thought it prudent to return to St. Anne's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He immediately called a council of war, and it was unanimously determined,
      that an attack should be made early the next morning. The enemy's forces,
      consisting of forty British troops, one hundred Canadians, and five
      hundred Indians, were commanded by Captain Forster; and the principal
      officer among the American prisoners was Major Sherburne. A little after
      midnight Lieutenant Park arrived at St. Anne's with a flag, bringing
      articles for an exchange of prisoners, which had been entered into between
      Major Sherburne and Captain Forster. This commander had assured Major
      Sherburne and the other American officers, that he could not control the
      Indians, and that all the prisoners would inevitably be murdered as soon
      as an attack should begin. The prisoners were crowded together in the
      church of Quinze Chiens, where they were guarded, and would fall an easy
      prey to the fury of the savages. In this distressing dilemma, revolting as
      it was to every principle of honor and justice, the dictates of humanity
      pointed to but one course. Major Sherburne accepted such terms as were
      imposed upon him; and the treaty <i>was</i> sent to be confirmed by
      General Arnold, with the positive declaration on the part of Captain
      Forster, that the fate of his companions in arms depended on his
      acquiescence. By the terms of the capitulation, it was agreed that the
      prisoners should be released on parole, in exchange for British prisoners
      of equal rank taken by the Americans. Six days were allowed for sending
      the prisoners to St. John's within the American lines. Four American
      captains were to go to Quebec and remain as hostages, till the exchange
      should be effected. Reparation was to be made for all property, that had
      been destroyed by the Continental troops. Such was the tenor of the
      articles as modified and approved by General Arnold. The British commander
      had at first insisted, that the American prisoners should not again take
      up arms, and that they should pledge themselves not to give any
      information by words, writing, or signs, which should be prejudicial to
      his Majesty's service. These terms were rejected without discussion.
      Fifteen Canadians, who were with the American troops at the Cedars, were
      not included in the treaty, as Captain Forster declared that he had
      positive orders to that effect. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * A different account of this affair is given by General Wilkinson,
      (Memoirs, Vol. I. p. 46,) but the above narrative is taken from a letter
      written by General Arnold a few hours after the capitulation was signed,
      and directed to the Commissioners from Congress then at Montreal. These
      circumstances invest it with every claim to be considered strictly
      accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congress refused to ratify this convention, except on such conditions as
      the British government would never assent to; and a general indignation
      was expressed at the subterfuge of barbarity by which it was extorted, so
      contrary to the rules of civilized warfare, and so abhorrent to the common
      sympathies of human nature. Since the compact was executed in due form,
      however, and by officers invested with proper authority, General
      Washington considered it binding, and expressed that opinion in decided
      language to Congress. In a military sense this may be presumed to have
      been a right view of the matter, and perhaps in the long run it was
      politic. The stain of ignominy, which must for ever adhere to the
      transaction, may be regarded as a punishment in full measure to the
      aggressing party, and as holding up an example, which all who value a good
      name, or have any respect for the universal sentiments of mankind, will
      take care not to imitate. General Howe wrote a complaining and reproachful
      letter to Washington on the proceedings of Congress; but the actual sense
      of the British authorities may be inferred from the fact, that the subject
      was allowed to drop into silence, and the hostages were sent home on
      parole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold returned with his detachment to Montreal. Disasters began to
      thicken in every part of Canada. The small-pox had made frightful ravages
      among the troops and was still increasing, provisions and every kind of
      supplies were wanting, the inhabitants were disgusted and alienated,
      having suffered from the exactions, irregularities, and misconduct of the
      Americans, who seized their property for the public service, and paid them
      in certificates and bills, which were worthless; reinforcements had come
      in so sparingly, that it was now impossible to withstand the force of the
      enemy, augmented by a large body of veteran troops recently arrived from
      Europe; confusion reigned every where, and a heavy gloom hung over the
      future. At this crisis, Franklin, Chase, and Carroll, arrived at Montreal
      as a committee from Congress. The state of affairs was already too
      desperate to be relieved by the counsels of wisdom, or the arm of
      strength. The American troops under General Thomas, driven from Quebec and
      pursued up the St. Lawrence, took post at Sorel. General Sullivan
      succeeded to the command; a last attempt was made to hold the ground, but
      it was more resolute in purpose than successful in the execution; the
      whole army was compelled precipitately to evacuate Canada, and retire over
      the Lake to Crown Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montreal was held till the last moment. Arnold then drew off his
      detachment, with no small risk of being intercepted by Sir Guy Carle-ton,
      and proceeded to St. John's, making, as General Sullivan wrote, "a very
      prudent and judicious retreat, with an enemy close at his heels." He had
      two days before been at St. John's, directed an encampment to be enclosed,
      and ordered the frame of a vessel then on the stocks to be taken to
      pieces, the timbers numbered, and the whole to be sent to Crown Point.
      General Sullivan soon arrived with the rear of his retreating army, and
      preparations were made for an immediate embarkation. To this work Arnold
      applied himself with his usual activity and vigilance, remaining behind
      till he had seen every boat leave the shore but his own. He then mounted
      his horse, attended by Wilkinson his aid-de-camp, and rode back two miles,
      when they discovered the enemy's advanced division in full march under
      General Burgoyne. They gazed at it, or, in military phrase, reconnoitred
      it, for a short time, and then hastened back to St. John's. A boat being
      in readiness to receive them, the horses were stripped and shot, the men
      were ordered on board, and Arnold, refusing all assistance, pushed off the
      boat with his own hands; thus, says Wilkinson, "indulging the vanity of
      being the last man, who embarked from the shores of the enemy." The sun
      was now down, and darkness followed, but the boat overtook the army in the
      night at Isle-aux-Noix.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t being necessary
      that General Schuyler should be made acquainted, as soon as possible, with
      the present condition of the army, and the progress of the enemy, General
      Arnold consented to go forward for that purpose. His knowledge of all that
      had passed in Canada, during the last seven months, enabled him to
      communicate the requisite intelligence in a more satisfactory manner than
      it could be done in writing, and to add full explanations to the
      despatches of the commander. He found General Schuyler in Albany, at which
      place General Gates arrived in a few days, proceeding by order of Congress
      to take command of the northern army. Meantime General Sullivan retreated
      to Crown Point. Schuyler, Gates, and Arnold repaired together to that
      post.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was expected that Sir Guy Carleton, as soon as he could provide
      water-craft sufficient, would make all haste up the Lake and commence an
      attack. A council of general officers was convened, who, after mature
      deliberation, resolved to abandon Crown Point, retire to Ticonde-roga,
      strengthen that post, and make it the principal station of defence. This
      measure was thought extraordinary by General Washington and by Congress.
      It was looked upon as giving up a position, formidable in itself and by
      artificial works, which afforded advantages at least for checking the
      enemy, if not for repelling their farther approach. The members of the
      council were unanimous; but many of the field-officers partook of the
      prevailing sentiment, although on the spot, and signed a remonstrance
      against the decision of their superiors. A proceeding so unmilitary, and
      so little in accordance with sound discipline, was of course disregarded,
      but dissatisfaction and ill feelings were excited on both sides. Schuyler
      and Gates defended the resolve of the council in letters to Washington and
      Congress, and in the end no one doubted its wisdom. Crown Point had from
      circumstances acquired a name in former wars, which had magnified it in
      public opinion much beyond its real importance as a military post. It was
      moreover impolitic to divide the troops, few in number compared with those
      of the enemy, by attempting to fortify and defend two positions within
      fifteen miles of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The army was accordingly withdrawn to Ticonderoga, and every preparation
      was there begun for meeting the enemy, whenever they should make their
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things were going on, General Arnold brought up another
      matter, which scattered new seeds of dissension in the camp. Colonel Hazen
      had been his second in command at Montreal, and, from the elements of
      Arnold's character, this fact might perhaps lead to a natural inference,
      that a quarrel would not be an unlikely event. The particulars are these.
      When it became evident that Canada would be evacuated, Arnold seized goods
      belonging to merchants in Montreal, which he said were intended for the
      public service. Certificates were given to the owners, who were to be paid
      according to their invoices by the United States. In many cases, however,
      they were taken away in such a hurry, that there was no time for making
      out a list of the articles, and the only form of delivery was the owner's
      name written on each parcel. Arnold sent the goods across the country to
      Chamblee, with the intention of having them forwarded to St. John's, and
      thence by water to Ticonderoga. He instructed Colonel Hazen, who then
      commanded at Chamblee, to take charge of them, and prevent their being
      damaged. Hazen, either not liking the manner in which the goods had been
      obtained, or from personal hostility to Arnold, refused for some time to
      meddle with them, and left them exposed to the weather, piled in heaps on
      the bank of the river; and at last, when he took them in charge, they were
      guarded in so negligent a manner, that the packages were broken open and
      many of them plundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owners, not contented to part with their goods upon terms so vague and
      uncertain, followed the army to Crown Point. When they found what ravages
      had been committed on their property, they presented invoices and claimed
      pay for the full amount. The blame fell upon General Arnold, as the first
      mover in the business, and he threw it back upon Hazen, who had refused to
      obey his order and take care of the goods. The result was a court-martial,
      by which Colonel Hazen was tried for disobedience of orders. While the
      trial was in progress, the court declined accepting the testimony of Major
      Scott, one of Arnold's principal witnesses, on the ground of his being a
      party concerned, since he was the agent, who received the goods at
      Montreal and conducted them to Chamblee. This slight was too much for the
      hot blood of Arnold, and he wrote a disrespectful letter to the court in
      the form of a protest. To save their honor, the court demanded an apology,
      which was promptly refused in a tone of insult by their antagonist, with a
      broad intimation, that he should be ready at a proper time to give any or
      all of the gentlemen of the court satisfaction on that score; or, in other
      words, the letter was a sort of challenge to the whole court, either in
      the corporate or individual capacity of the members. This was so gross a
      violation of military rule, that the court had now no other resort than an
      appeal to General Gates, the commander-in-chief. The case presented
      difficulties which seemed to embarrass him, as Arnold was much in his
      favor, and he had resolved to appoint him to the command of the fleet then
      preparing to meet the enemy on the Lake. In short, he dissolved the
      court-martial, and thus abetted the conduct of Arnold. In explaining this
      step to Congress, he said that he had been obliged to act "dictatorially"
      when the court demanded the arrest of General Arnold, adding, "The United
      States must not be deprived of that excellent officer's services at this
      important moment." Justice might well complain, when policy could content
      itself with such a reason for an arbitrary act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court passed judgment before they separated, although informally, and
      acquitted Colonel Hazen with honor. This was an implied censure upon
      Arnold; but, protected as he was by his superior, the affair received no
      further investigation. His military popularity sustained him as an
      officer, but his character suffered essentially in the public estimation.
      It was more than suspected, that his private interest was chiefly
      consulted in seizing the goods, and it seems to have been supposed, that
      the seizure was upon his own authority. In these respects it is probable
      he was too harshly judged. He wrote a letter to General Schuyler from
      Montreal, while in the act of taking the goods, acquainting him with the
      fact, and adding that he was thus directed by the commissioners from
      Congress. He also wrote to General Sullivan from Chamblee, informing him
      of the damaged condition in which he found the packages at that place, and
      complaining of the disobedience and neglect of Colonel Hazen. These
      letters are now extant, and evidently prove, that he was not practising
      any secret manouvre in the removal of the goods, or for retaining them in
      his own possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must nevertheless be conceded, that his mode of taking the property
      without leaving in the owner's hands invoices of the different articles,
      and certificates of having received them, could not be justified, nor
      could it have been intended by the commissioners. They could mean nothing
      more, than such things as would serve to Supply the army either with
      provisions or clothing, and these upon a fair security to the owners; for,
      by the articles of capitulation entered into with General Montgomery, the
      citizens were to be maintained in a free possession of their goods and
      effects of every kind, whereas packages containing silks, and other
      articles equally inapplicable to the object in view, were carried off
      indiscriminately. These circumstances, and his conduct to the
      court-martial, produced impressions, which the subsequent developements of
      his character contributed nothing to efface or diminish; and, viewed in
      the most favorable light, his honesty can be screened only at the expense
      of his judgment and delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have dwelt the longer on this transaction, because it was the first
      important link in the chain of incidents, which led to his final ruin.
      Another, somewhat akin to it, occurred nearly at the same time. There had
      been a quarrel at Quebec between Arnold and Major Brown, who had marched
      to that place with General Montgomery. This enmity had its origin as early
      as the capture of Ticonderoga by Ethan Allen, when Brown was an officer
      under Colonel Easton, and of course opposed to the pretensions of Arnold
      on that occasion. From Quebec letters were written by Arnold to some of
      the members of Congress, containing severe reflections on his conduct, and
      open charges against him of having plundered the baggage and property of
      prisoners taken in Canada. When these particulars were made known to Brown
      by his friends, he demanded from General Wooster, and afterwards from
      General Thomas, a court of inquiry; but through the machinations of Arnold
      he was defeated in his purpose, till after the evacuation of Canada. He
      then applied in person to Congress for redress, and directions were sent
      to the commander in the northern department to grant a court of inquiry.
      Colonel Brown, for such was now his title, renewed his application to
      General Gates at Ticonderoga, but with no better success than before. As
      in the case of the court-martial, Gates chose to exercise a dictatorial
      authority, and protect his favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was done till the end of the campaign, when Colonel Brown
      presented his application in another form, demanding an arrest of General
      Arnold on a series of charges, in which he was accused of numerous
      misdemeanors and criminal acts during the course of his command. General
      Gates replied, that he would lay the petition before Congress. Being thus
      baffled in his attempts to obtain justice through the proper channel,
      Colonel Brown published a narrative of the whole affair, introducing his
      charges against Arnold, and commenting upon his conduct with much
      severity, and indeed with a warmth that indicated too great a degree of
      excited feeling. The result will be seen hereafter. It is a little
      remarkable, that, in the midst of all these censures, Arnold never
      solicited a court of inquiry on his own part, by which, if they were
      unjust and without foundation, he might at once have silenced his enemies,
      and which it would be natural to expect under such circumstances from a
      man, possessing a quick sense of honor, who was conscious of his
      innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the army had retreated to Crown Point and Ticonderoga, no time
      was lost and no efforts were spared in pressing forward preparations for
      defence, both by land and water. The British would of course pursue their
      way over the Lake, the moment they could construct or collect at St.
      John's suitable vessels for the purpose. To baffle such a movement, or at
      least to embarrass it as much as possible, it was extremely important that
      the marine force should be put on the most respectable footing, and
      increased to the utmost limit, which the resources in hand would admit.
      Great inconveniences were to be encountered in effecting this object; few
      materials for ship-building were in readiness; shipwrights, carpenters,
      and many essential articles for fitting out the vessels were to be
      obtained from the seaports. Such was the promptness and energy, however,
      with which the work was prosecuted, that by the middle of August a little
      squadron was prepared to sail, consisting of one sloop, three schooners,
      and five gondolas. The sloop carried twelve guns, one schooner the same
      number, the others eight, and the gondolas three each. These vessels
      rendezvoused at Crown Point under the the command of Arnold, and before
      the end of the month he sailed with his whole armament down the Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his instructions from General Gates, he was to take his station at the
      Isle-aux-Têtes, where there was a narrow pass in the Lake, and beyond that
      point he was ordered in positive terms not to advance. The order stated,
      that, as the present operations were designed to be wholly on the
      defensive, the business of the fleet was to prevent or repel a hostile
      invasion, but not to run any wanton risks or seek an encounter within the
      enemy's territory. In all other respects the discretion of the commander
      was to be his guide. On his arrival at Windmill Point, four miles from
      Isle-aux-Têtes, he discovered the island to be occupied by the enemy,
      numbers of whom were likewise encamped on the shores of the Lake. This
      induced him to stop at Windmill Point, and moor his vessels in a line
      across the Lake, so as to prevent any of the enemy's boats from passing *
      Crown Point. Hence he charges Arnold with disobedience of orders at the
      outset, in having gone beyond that place. But the actual site of
      Isle-aux-Têtes was at the lower end of the Lake, almost in contact with
      the Canada line, and in the vicinity of what is now called Rouse's Point.
      It was intended that the fleet should be stationed as near the line as
      prudence would admit, and the orders were strictly obeyed.&mdash;Wilkinson's
      Memoirs, Vol. I. p. 81.
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * General Wilkinson, by mistaking the position of Isle-aux-Têtes, has
      bestowed much unmerited censure upon Arnold. He supposes it to be at a
      place called Split Rock, which is but about twenty-five miles from Crown
      Point
    </p>
    <p>
      The decks of his vessels were so low, that he thought it necessary to
      erect around them barricades of fascines, which should protect them from
      being boarded by superior numbers in small craft. While his men were on
      shore cutting fascines, they were attacked by a party of British and
      Indians, and before they could reach their boat three were killed and six
      wounded. This circumstance proved to him the inexpediency of remaining in
      a position, where he was exposed to perpetual annoyance from the enemy,
      without having an adequate force to act by land. In a few days he returned
      eight or ten miles to Isle-la-Motte, and took a station more advantageous
      and secure, as the island was beyond the reach of an attack from the main
      land, and his guard-boats would discover any approach by water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small scouting parties were sent down on each side of the Lake, from whom
      intelligence was from time to time obtained, but not with such accuracy as
      to enable Arnold to judge of the extent of the enemy's naval preparations
      at St. John's. Being so well informed, nevertheless, as to deem it
      unadvisable to hazard an action in a part of the Lake, where he would be
      obliged to engage a superior force in an open encounter, he withdrew his
      fleet still farther back, and anchored it in a line between Valcour Island
      and the western shore of the Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since leaving Crown Point his armament had been reinforced, so that it now
      consisted of three schooners, two sloops, three galleys and eight
      gondolas. Early in the morning of the 11th of October, the guard-boats
      gave notice, that the enemy's fleet was in sight, off Cumberland Head,
      moving up the Lake. It soon appeared advancing around the southern point
      of Valcour Island, and presented a formidable aspect, there being one ship
      with three masts, two schooners, a radeau, one gondola, twenty gunboats,
      four longboats, and forty-four boats with provisions and troops. The armed
      vessels were manned by seven hundred chosen seamen. Such an array was
      enough to convince the Americans, that they must rely mainly on their
      bravery and the advantages of their position. The wind was likewise in
      their favor, as some of the larger vessels could not beat up sufficiently
      near to engage in the attack. While the enemy's fleet was coming round the
      island, Arnold had ordered his three galleys, and a schooner called the
      Royal Savage, to get under way and advance upon the enemy. On their return
      to the line the schooner grounded and was afterwards destroyed, but the
      men were saved. At half past twelve the action became general and very
      warm, the British having brought all their gunboats and one schooner
      within musket-shot of the American line. They kept up a heavy fire of
      round and grape shot, till five o'clock, when they withdrew from the
      contest and joined the ship and schooner, which a head wind had prevented
      from coming into action.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the contest Arnold was on board the Congress galley, which suffered
      severely. It received seven shot between wind and water, was hulled twelve
      times, the main mast was wounded in two places, the rigging cut in pieces,
      and the proportion of killed and wounded was unusually great. So deficient
      was the fleet in gunners, that Arnold himself pointed almost every gun
      that was fired from his vessel. The Washington galley was equally
      shattered; the first lieutenant was killed, and the captain and master
      wounded. All the officers of one of the gondolas, except the captain, were
      lost; and another gondola sunk soon after the engagement. The whole number
      of killed and wounded was about sixty. The enemy landed a large body of
      Indians, who kept up an incessant fire of musketry from the island and the
      opposite shore, but without effecting much injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      A consultation was held by the officers as soon as the engagement was
      over; and they agreed, that, considering the exhausted state of their
      ammunition, and the great superiority of the enemy's force both in ships
      and men, prudence required them to return to Crown Point, and if possible
      without risking another attack. The British had anchored their vessels in
      a line within a few hundred yards of the Americans, stretching from the
      island to the main, apparently to frustrate any such design. The night was
      dark, but a favoring breeze blew from the north, and before morning Arnold
      had passed with his whole fleet through the British line entirely
      undiscovered. This manoeuvre was not less bold in its execution, than
      extraordinary in its success. Arnold himself brought up the rear in his
      crippled galley, and, before their departure was known to the enemy, they
      had ascended the Lake ten or twelve miles to Schuyler's Island. Here they
      were obliged to cast anchor for half a day, in order to stop the leaks and
      repair their sails. Two of the gondolas were abandoned and sunk. In the
      afternoon they set sail again, but the wind had died away in the morning,
      and it now sprung up from the south, equally retarding the pursuit of the
      enemy and their own progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the second day the scene was changed. The Congress and
      Washington galleys, with four gondolas, had fallen in the rear, all being
      too much disabled to sail freely. The advanced ships of the enemy's fleet,
      in one of which was General Carleton, were found to be gaining upon them,
      under a press of sail, and in a short time were along-side. After
      receiving a few broadsides the Washington struck, having been extremely
      weakened by the loss of men and injury received in the first engagement.
      The whole force of the attack now fell upon Arnold in the Congress galley.
      A ship of eighteen guns, a schooner of fourteen, and another of twelve,
      poured forth an unceasing fire within musket shot. The contest was kept up
      with unparalleled resolution for four hours, when the gal-? ley was
      reduced almost to a wreck, and was surrounded by seven sail of the enemy.
      In this situation Arnold ran the galley and the four gondolas into a small
      creek, on the east side of the Lake, about ten miles from Crown Point; and
      as soon as they were aground, and were set on fire, he ordered the marines
      to leap into the water armed with muskets, wade to the beach, and station
      themselves in such a manner on the bank, as to prevent the approach of the
      enemy's small boats. He was the last man, that remained on board, nor did
      he leave his galley, till the fire had made such progress, that it could
      not be extinguished. The flags were kept flying, and he maintained his
      attitude of defence on the shore, till he saw them consumed, and the whole
      of his flotilla enveloped in flames. There are few instances on record of
      more deliberate courage and gallantry, than were displayed by him from the
      beginning to the end of this action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being no longer in a condition to oppose the enemy, he proceeded
      immediately through the woods with his men to Crown Point, and fortunately
      escaped an attack from the Indians, who waylaid the path two hours after
      he had passed. The same night he arrived at Ticonderoga. All his clothes,
      papers, and baggage had been burnt in the Royal Savage at Valcour Island.
      He found at Ticonderoga the remnant of his fleet, being two schooners, two
      galleys, one sloop, and one gondola. General Waterbury, who commanded the
      Washington galley, and one hundred and ten prisoners were returned on
      parole by General Carleton the day after the last action. The whole
      American loss in killed and wounded was between eighty and ninety. The
      enemy reported theirs to be about forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the signal failure of this enterprise, the valor and good
      conduct of the commander and his officers were themes of applause
      throughout the country. Arnold's popularity was prodigiously increased by
      it; and, although he was disliked in the army, as well from the spirit of
      jealousy commonly excited by an aspiring rival, as from the innate and
      irredeemable defects of his character, yet with the people at large these
      motives, if they existed at all, were swallowed up in an admiration of
      those imposing qualities and daring achievements, which are so apt to
      captivate the multitude, and which indeed in every stage of society are
      found to produce so strong an influence upon the mind. Some writers have
      commented on the execution of this enterprise in a tone of captious
      criticism, which can by no means be sustained on an impartial view of the
      subject. It is perhaps difficult to speak of the deeds of such a man as
      Arnold, without remembering the deplorable issue to which he was finally
      brought by his folly and wickedness; yet the historian should never
      forget, that he commits a crime little less flagrant in its nature, if
      inferior in its magnitude, when he allows himself to be so far moved by
      his feelings, as to depart from the strict line of truth and justice, or,
      by such an obliquity, to lead his readers to form a false and harsh
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold was sent out to meet the enemy. Whether he should fight or not, it
      is true, was left to his discretion. He chose the former and was beaten,
      but not till he had maintained a combat for half a day against a force
      nearly double his own, and caused the enemy to retire. This fact is enough
      to prove, that his position was judiciously chosen, and that the action on
      his part was skilfully fought. With consummate address he then penetrated
      the enemy's line, and brought off his whole fleet, shattered and disabled
      as it was, and succeeded at last in saving six of his vessels. Let it be
      supposed, that he had retreated before the British fleet, and left it to
      proceed unmolested. What would have been the consequence? There was a
      chance, at least, that he would be overtaken somewhere, and perhaps under
      circumstances of greater disadvantage. Even if he had escaped and moored
      his vessels under the guns of the fort at Ticonderoga, would the public
      have been satisfied with such a measure? Would not murmurs of complaint
      have been heard, that such expensive preparations should be made without
      any effect, or an attempt to repel the invaders? And would not a
      corresponding depression of public enthusiasm and spirit have followed?
      Whereas the event, as it turned out, was so gallant a demonstration of the
      courage and resolute ardor of the American troops, that it inspired
      universal confidence and hope at a very gloomy crisis of the revolution.
      It needs only be added, as a guide to a correct historical estimate of the
      transaction, that the conduct of Arnold was at the time approved by his
      military superiors, by Congress, and by the whole nation.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>eneral Carleton
      took possession of Crown Point, and for a few days menaced Ticonderoga;
      but, being convinced of his inability so late in the season to accomplish
      his main purpose of penetrating to Albany, he retired with his fleet and
      army down the Lake to seek winter-quarters in Canada. It was no longer
      necessary to keep up a formidable force in the northern department, and a
      large part of the troops was ordered from Ticonderoga to reinforce General
      Washington in Jersey, then retreating before a victorious enemy. Arnold
      was in this division, and he joined Washington's camp on the west side of
      the Delaware, a week preceding the memorable battle of Trenton. A letter
      had already been despatched to him, which had missed him in his route,
      containing directions to proceed immediately to Rhode Island, and, in
      conjunction with General Spencer, who commanded on that station, to rally
      the New England militia, and be prepared to resist the enemy, then
      hovering on the coast with a large number of ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained three days with the Commander-in-chief, and hastened to
      Providence, the headquarters of the eastern army. The British landed and
      took possession of Newport. The winter was passed by Spencer and Arnold in
      forming plans, and making preparations, to attack the garrison on Rhode
      Island; but these were all defeated by the impossibility of procuring
      troops sufficient for such an enterprise. Arnold spent some time in
      Boston, for the purpose of consulting with the principal persons of
      Massachusetts on this project, and of engaging the legislature of that
      State to call out an adequate force of the militia to secure its success.
      The attempt failed. All the States of New England were equally interested
      in driving the enemy from this new lodgment within their borders, all were
      equally disposed to do it; but the exhaustion of the last campaign could
      not be repaired in a moment, nor was the ardor of the people at so high a
      pitch as to induce them in the depth of winter to seek an enemy, contented
      to remain on an island, and from whom no immediate danger was apprehended.
      It is moreover to be kept in mind, that every effort was now making to
      fill up the Continental regiments, and reinforce the dwindled army under
      Washington at Morristown, as well as to prepare for the expected invasion
      from the north in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Arnold was engaged in this service, an incident happened, which made
      him begin to talk of the ingratitude of his country, and which had an
      important bearing on his future destiny. In February, 1777, Congress
      appointed five new major-generals, without including him in the list, all
      of whom were his juniors in rank, and one of them, General Lincoln, was
      promoted from the militia. It may well be imagined what effect this tacit
      censure and public slight would have on a person so sensitive to military
      glory, and whose reputation and prospects rested on that basis alone. He
      was totally unprepared for such a testimony of the sense of Congress, and
      his astonishment was not less than his indignation; but he had the
      self-command to conceal his emotions, and to demean himself with more
      moderation, than might have been expected. Washington was surprised and
      concerned, as he feared the ill effects, which such a practice might have
      upon the officers, knowing the extreme jealousy with which military men
      regard the subject of rank and promotion, and considering this feeling as
      essential to the vital interests of the army. He wrote to Arnold a
      soothing letter, begging him to take no hasty steps, and expressing his
      conviction that there was some mistake, which would in due time be
      rectified. He added assurances of his own endeavors to promote what he
      deemed in this case the claim of justice as well as of policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold replied in a subdued tone, but not without symptoms of strong
      feeling. "Congress undoubtedly have a right," said he, "of promoting
      those, whom, from their abilities and their long and arduous services,
      they esteem most deserving. Their promoting junior officers to the rank of
      major-generals, I view as a very civil way of requesting my resignation,
      as unqualified for the office I hold. My commission was conferred
      unsolicited, and received with pleasure only as a means of serving my
      country. With equal pleasure I resign it, when I can no longer serve my
      country with honor. The person, who, void of the nice feelings of honor,
      will tamely condescend to give up his right, and retain a commission at
      the expense of his reputation, I hold as a disgrace to the army and
      unworthy of the glorious cause in which we are engaged. When I entered the
      service of my country, my character was unimpeached. I have sacrificed my
      interest, ease, and happiness in her cause. It is rather a misfortune than
      a fault, that my exertions have not been crowned with success. I am
      conscious of the rectitude of my intentions. In justice, therefore, to my
      own character, and for the satisfaction of my friends, I must request a
      court of inquiry into my conduct; and, though I sensibly feel the
      ingratitude of my countrymen, yet every personal injury shall be buried in
      my zeal for the safety and happiness of my country, in whose cause I have
      repeatedly fought and bled, and am ready at all times to risk my life." No
      man certainly could talk in a more patriotic strain, and perhaps it is not
      too great a tax upon our faith to believe, that he was at this time as
      sincere as most patriots, who are reduced to the extremity of enumerating
      their disinterested sacrifices and services, as a vindication of their
      character, and a proof that the public have done them wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Washington was prompt to render the aid he had promised. He wrote
      to some of his friends in Congress on the subject, and requested General
      Greene, who was then at Philadelphia, to make particular inquiries. The
      avowed reason was, that the members from each State insisted upon having
      general officers proportioned to the number of troops furnished by it,
      and, as Connecticut had already two major-generals, there was no vacancy
      for another. "I confess," said General Washington, "this is a strange mode
      of reasoning, but it may show you that the promotion, which was due to
      your seniority, was not overlooked for want of merit in you." To the
      request for a court of inquiry he replied, that, as no specific charge had
      been alleged, he did not see on what ground such a court could be
      instituted; and, as public bodies were not responsible for their acts, all
      the satisfaction which an individual could obtain, if overlooked, was a
      consciousness that he did not deserve such treatment for his honest
      exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was kind and friendly, and might have afforded consolation to a
      philosopher; but Arnold had never been imbued with those maxims of wisdom
      which teach humility, nor learned the useful art of self-control to such
      an extent as to resist the impulse of a craving ambition, or endure the
      corrodings of wounded pride. He was well aware, also, that the ostensible
      motives of the majority of Congress were not the real ones; and this fact
      pressed upon him the unwelcome conviction, that his enemies were more
      numerous and active than he had ever imagined. Looking for the support of
      his reputation to the splendor of his military fame, and the prevailing
      power of popular applause over the opinions of all ranks of society, he
      had never prepared himself for such an expression of public sentiment, and
      his chagrin was in proportion to his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he resolved to visit head-quarters, and obtain permission to
      proceed in person to Philadelphia, and demand of Congress an investigation
      into his conduct. On his journey from Providence, he happened to be in
      Connecticut at the time when the British expedition, consisting of two
      thousand troops, under Governor Tryon, landed at Compo, near Fairfield,
      penetrated the country, and burnt the town of Danbury, with the public
      stores at that place. Generals Silliman and Wooster had succeeded in
      collecting suddenly about six hundred men, of whom one hundred were
      Continental troops, and the others militia, and pushed forward in pursuit
      of the enemy. Arnold joined them at a short distance from Reading, and
      they all marched to Bethel, about four miles from Danbury, where they
      arrived in the middle of the night, and learned that the town was
      destroyed, and the British preparing to retire. They halted at Bethel to
      refresh the troops till morning, and then separated their party into two
      divisions. At daylight two hundred men under General Wooster marched to
      harass the enemy in their rear. Arnold and Silliman headed the other
      division, amounting to four hundred, and took a different route, with the
      design of intercepting their retreat. It was at first uncertain whether
      Governor Tryon would go to the North River, and embark in the vessels then
      lying near Tarrytown, or return to the ships, which he had left in the
      Sound. All doubts were soon removed, however, by intelligence of his being
      in full march towards Compo.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Wooster overtook the enemy's rear guard, and commenced a spirited
      attack. It was repelled by discharges of artillery and musketry, which
      seemed at first to stagger his men, unaccustomed to scenes of battle. He
      had placed himself in their front, to encourage them forward, and had just
      called out, "Come on, my boys; never mind such random shot," when he
      received a wound in his side, which proved mortal. He fell from his horse,
      and was carried back to Danbury where he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eleven o'clock in the morning, Arnold's division had reached
      Ridgefield, having been augmented on the way to about five hundred men. He
      took a position at the northern extremity of the village, and erected a
      barricade of carts, logs, and earth across the road by which the British
      were to pass. The post was well chosen, the road was narrow, his right
      flank was covered by a house and barn, and his left by a ledge of rocks.
      At three o'clock the enemy appeared, marching in a solid column, and they
      commenced a heavy fire as they advanced towards the breast-work. It was
      briskly returned. For nearly a quarter of an hour the action was warm, and
      the Americans maintained their ground by the aid of their barricade
      against four times their number, until the British column began to extend
      itself, and to stretch around their flanks. This was a signal for a
      retreat. Arnold was the last man that remained behind. While alone in this
      situation, a platoon of British troops, who had clambered up the rocks on
      the left flank, discharged their muskets at him. His horse dropped
      lifeless, and when it was perceived that the rider did not fall, one of
      the soldiers rushed forward with a fixed bayonet intending to run him
      through. Arnold sat unmoved on his struggling horse, watched the soldier's
      approach till he was near enough to make sure his aim, then drew a pistol
      from the holsters and shot him dead. Seizing this critical opportunity, he
      sprang upon his feet and escaped unharmed. So remarkable an exhibition of
      cool and steady courage, in a moment of extreme danger, has rarely been
      witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rallied his men, and continued to annoy the enemy in their progress.
      Being reinforced the next day, he hung upon their flanks and rear
      throughout the whole march to their ships, attacking them at every
      assailable point. In a skirmish near Cornpo, just before the British
      embarked, the horse which he rode was shot through the neck, and on all
      occasions he exposed himself with his accustomed intrepidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of these exploits passed quickly to Congress, and without delay
      Arnold was promoted to the rank of major-general. But, with an
      inconsistency not easily accounted for, his relative rank was not
      restored, and he was still left by the date of his commission below the
      five major-generals, who had been raised over him. If his merit as an
      officer now required his advancement, notwithstanding the former
      objections, it would seem to have been a proper act of magnanimity to
      place him where the reproach upon his military honor would be removed, and
      his sense of justice satisfied. To degrade and promote at the same time
      was a singular mode of bestowing reward, or expressing approbation. Arnold
      regarded it in that light, and was by no means at ease with his new
      appointment thus grudgingly conferred, or rather extorted by the fresh
      laurels he had won on the field of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Washington, sensible of the delicacy of his situation, and valuing
      highly his services, hastened to make the best amends in his power for the
      neglect of Congress, by appointing him to the command on the North River,
      which, at that juncture was as honorable a post as any officer in the army
      could hold. He declined the offer, however, and obtained the consent of
      the Commander-in-chief to go to Philadelphia, and prosecute his first
      design of applying in person to Congress for an examination into his
      conduct. He soon discovered, what he before had sufficient reason to
      apprehend, that the unfavorable reports of his behavior at Montreal and
      Ticonderoga, added to a conviction of the inherent defects of his private
      character, which every body was ready to acknowledge, were the prevailing
      causes of the disrepute in which he was held by a majority of that body.
      These stern patriots, regarding virtue as essential to true honor, did not
      consider great examples of valor, resource, and energy, even in arousing
      and sustaining the military ardor of a country, as an adequate
      counterpoise to a dereliction of principle and a compromising integrity.
      How far a judicious policy and pure patriotism were combined on this
      occasion, or to what extent party zeal contributed to warp the judgment,
      we need not now inquire. It is enough to know, that impressions were fixed
      and their influence was felt. To remove the former and weaken the latter
      was the task, which Arnold set himself to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      His complaints were loud, and expressed with a show of sensibility, which
      from any other man might seem to be sincere. "I am exceedingly unhappy,"
      said he, in writing to Congress, "to find, that, after having made every
      sacrifice of fortune, ease, and domestic happiness to serve my country, I
      am publicly impeached (in particular by Lieutenant-Colonel Brown) of a
      catalogue of crimes, which, if true, ought to subject me to disgrace,
      infamy, and the just resentment of my countrymen. Conscious of the
      rectitude of my intentions, however I may have erred in judgment, I must
      request the favor of Congress to point out some mode, by which my conduct
      and that of my accusers may be inquired into, and justice done to the
      innocent and injured." This letter was referred to the Board of War. As a
      proof, that the poison of party was then rankling in the national
      councils, and that it was not inoperative in this affair, we may cite a
      letter written by Richard Henry Lee, on the day that the above complaint,
      or petition, was presented. "One plan," he observes, "now in frequent use,
      is to assassinate the characters of the friends of America, in every place
      and by every means; at this moment they are reading in Congress a bold and
      audacious attempt of this kind against the brave General Arnold."
    </p>
    <p>
      After examining all the papers in their possession, and holding a
      conference with General Arnold, and with Mr. Carroll (one of the
      commissioners from Congress at Montreal when the former commanded there),
      the Board of War reported, that they were entirely satisfied as to the
      character and conduct of General Arnold, which, in the language of the
      Board, had been "so cruelly and groundlessly aspersed." The report was
      confirmed by Congress; yet, strange as it may appear, his rank was not
      restored, nor was any resolution adopted on that head; and he was thus
      left with all his griefs bearing as heavily upon him as before; and indeed
      more so, since their burden was increased by this unexpected but
      convincing proof of the deep-rooted hostility of his opponents, and of
      their being influenced by motives, which he had not anticipated. His
      disappointment was the greater at this moment, as Congress had two days
      before complimented him with the gift of a horse, properly caparisoned,
      being a token of their approbation of his recent gallant conduct against
      the enemy. It was no wonder, that this giving with one hand and taking
      away with the other, exciting hope and defeating expectation with the same
      breath, should worry and disgust a man, who had a right to look for
      consistency if not for favor. This duty Congress owed to themselves, for
      the sake of their own dignity; and they certainly owed it to every
      officer, whom they deemed worthy of a commission in the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another circumstance now occurred, which involved the case in new
      difficulties. General Arnold presented his accounts to Congress, and
      requested an examination of them by a committee. For the want of proper
      regulations in the various military departments at the beginning of the
      war, the business of purchases, payments, and other money concerns, rested
      mainly with the commanders of detachments. This system prevailed in the
      Canada expedition as a matter of necessity. By the peculiarity of his
      situation, from the time he left Cambridge until the evacuation of Canada,
      Arnold was compelled on many occasions to act in the triple capacity of
      commander, commissary, and paymaster. Hence his accounts were voluminous
      and extremely complicated, and in many parts without vouchers or proper
      certificates. This irregularity was to be expected from the nature of the
      case; but it was soon discovered, that he had introduced a series of
      extravagant charges in his own favor, some of them dubious in their
      character, and others manifestly unreasonable, even if the items could be
      proved, which in the aggregate swelled his personal claims upon the
      government to an enormous amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was no pretence of his having carried his own money into the
      service in any considerable quantity, and as his credit was not of a kind
      to command large resources upon his individual responsibility, the inquiry
      very naturally arose, how he could in the space of a few months, while
      discharging an active and arduous military duty, accumulate property to
      such an amount, as appeared in the balance of his accounts. In short,
      every one perceived, that there was a fallacy, a deception, or an impudent
      attempt to overreach and defraud the public. His enemies in Congress
      gained new strength to their cause by these developements, and his friends
      were vexed at the hard task they had undertaken, of vindicating and
      sustaining a man, whose merits as an officer were of the highest order,
      and whose services they deemed invaluable to the country, but who, by the
      deplorable perversion of his moral qualities, was using the ascendency he
      had acquired as a means of robbing that very public, which, under the
      guise of a hypocritical patriotism, he pretended to serve from
      disinterested motives, and at a great sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the committee were engaged in examining the accounts, Arnold was
      appointed to the command of the army then convening in the neighborhood of
      Philadelphia, and awaiting the movements of General Howe, who, it was
      supposed, would open the campaign by a renewal of his attempt to cross the
      Delaware, and march into Pennsylvania. When this officer made a
      demonstration from Brunswic towards Washington's encampment, with a view
      of bringing that cautious commander to a general action, it was thought
      his design was against Philadelphia, and Arnold was sent forward by
      Congress to take post on the Delaware above Trenton, to examine the
      passes, secure the boats, and cooperate with General Washington in
      opposing the enemy's advance. This duty he discharged with his usual
      promptness and energy, and, when the British general retired to Brunswic,
      he returned to his head-quarters at Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime his accounts lingered in the hands of the Committee, who had
      delayed making a report, and seemed not inclined to hasten it; nor had any
      notice been taken of his reiterated demands to have his rank adjusted. His
      impetuous temper could not brook this neglect, and his patience was
      exhausted. He wrote a letter to Congress, tendering a resignation of his
      commission, declaring at the same time, that he was driven to this step
      only by a sense of the injustice he had suffered, and professing an ardent
      love of his country, and his readiness to risk his life in its cause; but,
      he added, "honor is a sacrifice no man ought to make; as I received, so I
      wish to transmit it inviolate to posterity." Just at this crisis came the
      intelligence of the disasters on the northern frontiers, the unexpected
      evacuation of Ticonderoga, and the approach of the formidable army under
      Burgoyne; and it so happened, that, on the same day that the above letter
      of resignation was communicated to Congress, they received a letter from
      General Washington, recommending that General Arnold should be immediately
      sent to join the northern army. "He is active, judicious, and brave," said
      Washington, "and an officer in whom the militia will repose great
      confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Flattered by this preference, and looking forward to a scene of action in
      which he always delighted, he did not hesitate to comply with the order,
      and suspend his demand of permission to resign, adding only, that he
      should leave it with Congress, and made no doubt they would listen to it
      when the service now before him should be accomplished. He went still
      farther and volunteered an act of magnanimity, which certainly must extort
      praise, if it cannot win esteem. General St. Clair was in the northern
      army, and he was one of the five major-generals, who had been promoted
      over Arnold. With his keen sensibilities on this subject, it might be
      presumed that he would insist on his rights, and refuse to be commanded by
      an officer thus situated; but he generously waved all considerations of
      that kind, declaring that he would do his duty faithfully in the rank he
      then held, and trust to the justice of his claims for a future reparation.
      This pacific overture, it is true, was owing in no small degree to the
      solicitude of Washington, whom he knew to be his sincere friend, and whose
      judgment was compromised in recommending him to this appointment.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>rnold arrived at
      Fort Edward and joined General Schuyler in the latter part of July. The
      array was then preparing to move five miles lower down the Hudson, and
      form an encampment on the high grounds near Moses Creek, which had been
      selected for the purpose by Kosciuszko. At the time of this movement the
      army was separated into two divisions, one of which was put under the
      command of Arnold, whose headquarters were between Moses Creek and Fort
      Edward. Four days after he had taken this station, a tragical event
      happened within the limits of his command, which, from its singular
      barbarity and the circumstances attending it, has been commemorated by
      historians, and will be perpetuated as a memento of the melancholy fate of
      suffering innocence, and an affecting record of the horrors of savage
      warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murder of Jane M'Crea has been a theme, which eloquence and
      sensibility have alike contributed to dignify, and which has kindled in
      many a breast the emotions of a responsive sympathy. General Gates's
      description, in his letter to Burgoyne, although more ornate than
      forcible, and abounding more in bad taste than simplicity or pathos, was
      suited to the feelings of the moment, and produced a lively impression in
      every part of America; and the glowing language of Burke, in one of his
      most celebrated speeches in the British Parliament, made the story of Jane
      M'Crea familiar to the European world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young lady was the daughter of a clergyman, who died in New Jersey
      before the Revolution. Upon her father's death she sought a home in the
      house of her brother, a respectable gentleman residing on the western bank
      of Hudson's River, about four miles below Fort Edward. Here she formed an
      intimacy with a young man, named David Jones, to whom it was understood
      she was engaged to be married. When the war broke out, Jones took the side
      of the royalists, went to Canada, received a commission, and was a captain
      or lieutenant among the provincials in Burgoyne's army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fort Edward was situate on the eastern margin of Hudson's River, within a
      few yards of the water, and surrounded by a plain of considerable extent,
      which was cleared of wood and cultivated. On the road leading to the
      north, and near the foot of a hill about one third of a mile from the
      fort, stood a house occupied by Mrs. McNiel, a widow lady and an
      acquaintance of Miss McCrea, with whom she was staying as a visitor at the
      time the American army was in that neighborhood. The side of the hill was
      covered with a growth of bushes, and on its top, a quarter of a mile from
      the house, stood a large pine tree, near the root of which gushed out a
      perennial spring of water. A guard of one hundred men had been left at the
      fort, and a picket under Lieutenant Van Vechten was stationed in the woods
      on the hill a little beyond the pine tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early one morning this picket guard was attacked by a party of Indians,
      rushing through the woods from different points at the same moment, and
      rending the air with hideous yells. Lieutenant Van Vechten and five others
      were killed and scalped, and four were wounded. Samuel Standish, one of
      the guard, whose post was near the pine tree, discharged his musket at the
      first Indian he saw, and ran down the hill towards the fort; but he had no
      sooner reached the plain, than three Indians, who had pursued him to cut
      off his retreat, darted out of the bushes, fired, and wounded him in the
      foot. One of them sprang upon him, threw him to the ground, pinioned his
      arms, and then pushed him violently forward up the hill. He naturally made
      as much haste as he could, and in a short time they came to the spring,
      where several Indians were assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Standish was left to himself, at a little distance from the spring
      and the pine tree, expecting every moment to share the fate of his
      comrades, whose scalps were conspicuously displayed. A few minutes only
      had elapsed, when he saw a small party of Indians ascending the hill, and
      with them Mrs. McNiel and Miss McCrea on foot. He knew them both, having
      often been at Mrs. McNiel's house. The party had hardly joined the other
      Indians, when he perceived much agitation among them, high words and
      violent gestures, till at length they engaged in a furious quarrel, and
      beat one another with their muskets. In the midst of this fray, one of the
      chiefs, apparently in a paroxysm of rage, shot Miss McCrea in the breast.
      She instantly fell and expired. Her hair was long and flowing. The same
      chief grasped it in his hand, seized his knife, and took off the scalp in
      such a manner as to include nearly the whole of the hair; then springing
      from the ground, he tossed it in the face of a young warrior, who stood
      near him watching the operation, brandished it in the air, and uttered a
      yell of savage exultation. When this was done the quarrel ceased; and, as
      the fort had already been alarmed, the Indians hurried away as quickly as
      possible to General Fraser's encampment on the road to Fort Anne, taking
      with them Mrs. McNiel and Samuel Standish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bodies of the slain were found by a party, that went in pursuit, and
      were carried across the river. They had been stripped of their clothing,
      and the body of Miss McCrea was wounded in nine places, either by a
      scalping knife or a tomahawk. A messenger was despatched to convey the
      afflicting intelligence to her brother, who arrived soon afterwards, took
      charge of his sister's remains, and had them interred on the east side of
      the river about three miles below the fort. The body of Lieutenant Van
      Vechten was buried at the same time and on the same spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      History has preserved no facts by which we can at this day ascertain the
      reason, why Miss McCrea should remain as she did in so exposed and
      unprotected a situation. She had been reminded of her danger by the people
      at the fort. Tradition relates, however, and with seeming truth, that
      through some medium of communication she had promised her lover, probably
      by his advice, to remain in this place, until the approach of the British
      troops should afford her an opportunity to join him, in company with her
      hostess and friend. It is said, that, when they saw the Indians coming to
      the house, they were at first frightened and attempted to escape; but, as
      the Indians made signs of a pacific intention, and one of them held up a
      letter intimating that it was to be opened, their fears were calmed and
      the letter was read. It was from Jones, and contained a request that they
      would put themselves under the charge of the Indians, whom he had sent for
      the purpose, and who would guard them in safety to the British camp.
      Unfortunately two separate parties of Indians, or at least two chiefs
      acting independently of each other, had united in this enterprise,
      combining with it an attack of the picket guard. It is incredible that
      Jones should have known this part of the arrangement, or he would have
      foreseen the danger it threatened. When the prize was in their hands, the
      two chiefs quarrelled about the mode of dividing the reward they were to
      receive; and, according to the Indian rule of settling disputes in the
      case of captives, one of them in a wild fit of passion killed the victim
      and secured the scalp. Nor is it the least shocking feature of the
      transaction, that the savage seemed not aware of the nature of his
      mission. Uninformed as to the motive of his employer for obtaining the
      person of the lady, or not comprehending it, he regarded her in the light
      of a prisoner, and supposed the scalp would be an acceptable trophy. Let
      it be imagined what were the feelings of the anxious lover, waiting with
      joyful anticipation the arrival of his intended bride, when this appalling
      proof of her death was presented to him. The innocent had suffered by the
      hand of cruelty and violence, which he had unconsciously armed; his most
      fondly cherished hopes were blasted, and a sting was planted in his soul,
      which time and forgetfulness could never eradicate. His spirit was scathed
      and his heart broken. He lived but a few years, a prey to his sad
      recollections, and sunk into the grave under the burden of his grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of this melancholy tale is still cherished with a lively
      sympathy by the people, who dwell near the scene of its principal
      incidents. The inhabitants of the village of Fort Edward have lately
      removed the remains of Miss McCrea from their obscure resting-place, and
      deposited them in the public burial-ground. The ceremony was solemn and
      impressive. A procession of young men and maidens followed the relics, and
      wept in silence when the earth was again closed over them, thus exhibiting
      an honorable proof of sensibility and of respect for the dead. The little
      fountain still pours out its clear waters near the brow of the hill, and
      the venerable pine is yet standing in its ancient majesty, broken at the
      top and shorn of its branches by the winds and storms of half a century,
      but revered as marking the spot where youth and innocence were sacrificed
      in the tragical death of Jane McCrea. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * The circumstances attending the murder of Miss McCrea have been
      variously represented. Samuel Standish himself related to me the above
      particulars, as far as they came under his own observation. When he
      arrived at the British camp he was taken before General Fraser, who asked
      him many questions and treated him kindly. He was then sent a prisoner to
      Ticonderoga, whence he contrived to make his escape two months afterwards.
      Miles Standish, the famous military leader of the first Pilgrims at
      Plymouth, was his ancestor in a direct line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first report of the attack upon the picket guard, which was brought to
      Arnold, magnified the number of the assailants so much, that he detached a
      thousand men, with orders to march in two divisions, one to fall upon
      their rear, and the other to gain their front. The attempt was defeated by
      a heavy shower of rain, which wet the arms of the troops and damaged their
      powder. It is not likely, indeed, that in any event they would have
      overtaken the enemy, who moved off without delay, and were not inclined to
      wait an attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after this affair an advanced party of the British troops took
      possession of Fort Edward, and General Schuyler soon retreated with his
      whole army to Stillwater. In the mean time the question of Arnold's rank
      was again brought up in Congress, and decided against him by a majority of
      nearly three to one. It was the first occasion on which the yeas and nays
      were entered in the journals. Arnold had previously received a letter from
      one of his friends in Congress, who assured him, that, in the present
      temper of the members, he could have no hope of the restoration of his
      rank. Piqued and mortified at this obstinate determination to withhold
      from him what he deemed to be a right, and from the refusal of which his
      reputation was suffering, he asked leave of General Schuyler to retire;
      but by the persuasion of that officer, and a representation of the
      absolute necessity of his services at so critical a moment, he was induced
      again to suspend his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the army was at Stillwater, intelligence arrived of the defeat of
      General Herkimer at the bloody battle of Oriskany, the investiture of Fort
      Schuyler by St. Leger with a large body of British troops, Canadians, and
      Indians, and the imminent danger to which the garrison was exposed. Eight
      hundred men under General Learned were immediately detached to the relief
      of the garrison. Arnold volunteered to command the expedition, and set off
      with instructions to call out as many of the militia as he could, and to
      adopt the most effectual measures to repel the enemy, and protect the
      settlements on the Mohawk River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington had already advised his being sent into that quarter, but
      General Schuyler was reluctant to spare him from the main army.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the detachment reached Fort Dayton at the German Flats, where there
      was a guard of Continental troops, it appeared by the adjutant's return,
      that the whole force then assembled was nine hundred and forty-six
      regulars, and less than one hundred militia. It was ascertained at the
      same time, that the number of the enemy besieging Fort Schuyler amounted
      to at least seventeen hundred, including one thousand Indians. In the
      opinion of a council of war, with these facts before them, it was
      imprudent to hazard an attack until a reinforcement could be obtained.
      Arnold accordingly sent an express to General Gates, who had superseded
      General Schuyler and was then at Van Schaick's Island, at the mouth of the
      Mohawk, soliciting an additional detachment of one thousand light troops.
      He likewise issued a tumid proclamation, after the example of Burgoyne and
      St. Leger, and, according to the fashion of those times, offering pardon
      to Indians, Germans, Americans, or Britons, if within ten days they would
      sue for protection and take the oath of allegiance to the United States,
      but threatening direful vengeance upon those, who should neglect this
      proffer of mercy, and be captured in prosecuting their hostile designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stratagems in war are sometimes more effectual than arms or military
      skill. A singular instance of this kind occurred on the present occasion.
      A man by the name of Cuyler was seized as a spy. * There was little doubt
      of his guilt, or at least of his coming under the heavy penalties of the
      proclamation. Cuyler was a refugee, an inhabitant of that region, a man of
      some consideration among the people, and known in the enemy's camp, whence
      he had lately come out with a flag to entice the settlers to rally under
      the standard of St. Leger. It is said to have been first suggested by
      Lieutenant-Colonel Brooks, of the Massachusetts line, to employ him as a
      messenger of deceptive intelligence to the enemy. He was brought before
      Arnold, who questioned him, and promised a pardon of all past offences and
      the security of his property, if he would return to St. Leger's camp, and
      make so exaggerated a report of the number of Americans approaching, as to
      alarm the Indians and cause them to despair of success. To this he
      assented, and his brother was retained in confinement as a hostage for the
      faithful fulfilment of his promise.
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * In some accounts he is called Hanyost Schuyler, which I am inclined to
      think was the true name; but historians have adopted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friendly Indian, wily by nature and skilled in artifice from habit,
      proposed that bullets should be shot through Cuyler's coat, which would
      give the greater plausibility to his story. Thus prepared he entered the
      forest, and in a little time fell in with one of the enemy's scouts, to
      whom he related the disaster of his having been taken and condemned as a
      spy, adding that he was about to be executed when he found means to elude
      his guards, but was pursued so closely as to be shot several times through
      his clothes, and had escaped with the utmost peril of his life. The same
      account he repeated to St. Leger, as soon as he came to the camp, and said
      that Arnold was advancing by rapid marches at the head of two thousand
      men. A second messenger followed close upon his heels, who magnified the
      number to three thousand, with the additional embellishment of their being
      very near at hand. The success of the stratagem was complete. A panic
      spread among the Indians, and two or three hundred decamped immediately.
      The chiefs insisted on a general retreat, and no arguments could prevail
      on them to remain. In a short time the whole camp was in confusion, and
      St. Leger was obliged to move off so precipitately, that fifty-nine tents
      were left standing, and various articles of baggage and camp equipage were
      scattered in every direction. The faithless savages, not contented to
      desert their friends, seized the opportunity to steal and plunder whatever
      came in their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuyler concealed himself and got safely into the fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was raised the siege of Fort Schuyler, and thus terminated St.
      Leger's expedition, from which great advantages had been expected by the
      British government in aid of General Bur-goyne. Almost immediately after
      sending to Gates for a reinforcement, Arnold resolved to march forward
      with such troops as he had; and the news of St. Leger's retreat met him
      twenty-two miles from the fort. This movement, which was reported by the
      scouts, gave credit to the exaggerated statements of the messengers. He
      advanced to the fort, where he continued but a short time, and then
      returned to General Gates's army, having been absent twenty days. Colonel
      Gansevoort, who commanded at Fort Schuyler, sustained the siege with
      firmness and bravery. Lieutenant-Colonel Willett, the second in command,
      distinguished himself in a sortie from the garrison, and by other acts of
      military enterprise, which, the British Annual Register said, merited the
      praise even of an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The left wing of Gates's army was now at Loudon's Ferry, on the south bank
      of the Mohawk River, five miles above its confluence with the Hudson. The
      command at that post was assigned to Arnold. Two brigades and Morgan's
      battalion of riflemen were stationed there, to prevent General Burgoyne
      from crossing the Mohawk, should his march be continued thus far towards
      Albany. This event, however, was not destined to happen. The fatal defeat
      at Bennington, and the entire failure of the western expedition, had
      weakened his strength, depressed his hopes, and taught him caution. He
      lingered at Saratoga, and the American army, elated by their good fortune
      and encouraged by the reviving spirit of the country, retraced their steps
      and encamped on Behmus's Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this encampment Arnold still retained the left division of the army,
      consisting of the same regiments as at Loudon's Ferry. On the morning of
      the 19th of September, seven days after the camp had been formed,
      intelligence was brought that parties of the enemy were advancing within
      two or three miles of the lines. Arnold expressed his opinion to General
      Gates, that troops should march out and attack them; and he accordingly
      received orders to send Morgan's riflemen and Dearborn's light infantry,
      and to support them if necessary. An action was brought on, which lasted
      from half past twelve o'clock till night, and was fought wholly by
      detachments from Arnold's division, except one regiment only from another
      brigade. Wilkinson says, that no general officer was on the field of
      battle during the day; but when, towards evening, Gates and Arnold were
      together in the front of the camp, and Colonel Lewis came in from the
      scene of action and stated that its progress was undecisive, Arnold
      exclaimed, "I will soon put an end to it," and set off in a full gallop
      from the camp. Under the apprehension that he would do some rash thing, as
      Wilkinson goes on to say, Gates despatched an officer after him and
      ordered him back. It thus appears, that he was neither ordered out, nor
      permitted to go out, to take any part in the action. To a man, whose
      element was fighting, and whose ambition for military glory was equalled
      only by his bravery in acquiring it, this check upon his aspirations must
      have been keenly felt, whatever motives for imposing it may have actuated
      his superior in command.
    </p>
    <p>
      A serious misunderstanding arose at this time between Gates and Arnold,
      which several circumstances conspired to foment. In the first place, a
      part of Arnold's division was withdrawn without his knowledge, and he was
      put in the ridiculous light, as he called it, of presuming to give orders,
      which were contravened by the general orders of the commander-in-chief.
      This is supposed to have been owing to the officious interference of
      Wilkinson, who was adjutant-general to the army, and who insisted on the
      returns of a part of Arnold's division being made directly to him, and
      influenced Gates to sustain his demand, which was done in general orders,
      without giving notice to Arnold. Again, it was ascertained, that in his
      official communication to Congress, respecting the battle, Gates had said
      nothing of Arnold or his division, but merely stated that the action was
      fought by detachments from the army. Arnold complained of this neglect as
      ungenerous, not more in regard to himself than to the troops under his
      immediate command. "Had my division behaved ill," said he, "the other
      division of the army would have thought it extremely hard to have been
      amenable for their conduct." High words and harsh language passed between
      the two generals, and Gates went so far as to tell Arnold, that he thought
      him of little consequence in the army, that when General Lincoln arrived
      he should take away his command of a division, and that he was ready to
      give him a pass to leave the camp whenever he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      A correspondence followed; haughty and arrogant on the part of Gates,
      intemperate and indiscreet on that of Arnold. The latter demanded a pass
      for himself and suite to join General Washington. It was granted; but he
      changed his mind when he had taken time for reflection, rightly perceiving
      the hazard to which he would subject his reputation by voluntarily
      retiring from the army when another action might be hourly expected. He
      remained, although deprived of his command, and without any employment in
      the camp. Gates took the division under his own immediate charge, General
      Lincoln in the meantime being put in command of the right wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which party in the dispute was the most blamable, it would be difficult
      now to decide. That Gates was overbearing is certain; that Arnold was
      Impetuous and presuming may as little be doubted. He probably relied too
      much on the professions of friendship, and acts of indulgence, which the
      same commander had manifested in his favor the year before at Ticonderoga.
      There is room to believe, also, that a spice of jealousy mingled with
      Gates's feelings on this occasion. Colonel Varick, writing from camp to
      General Schuyler, three days after the action, said, "He seems to be
      piqued, that Arnold's division had the honor of beating the enemy on the
      19th. This I am certain of, that Arnold has all the credit of the action.
      And this I further know, that Gates asked where the troops were going,
      when Scammell's battalion marched out, and, upon being told, he declared
      no more troops should go; he would not suffer the camp to be exposed. Had
      Gates complied with Arnold's repeated desires, he would have obtained a
      general and complete victory over the enemy. But it is evident to me, he
      never intended to fight Bur-goyne, till Arnold urged, begged, and
      entreated him to do it." After the convention of Saratoga, Colonel Varick
      again wrote as follows in a letter from Albany. "During Burgoyne's stay
      here, he gave Arnold great credit for his bravery and military abilities,
      especially in the action of the 19th, whenever he spoke of him, and once
      in the presence of Gates." From this testimony it may be inferred, that
      the causes of the quarrel did not grow altogether out of the relations of
      rank in which the two parties stood to each other. Personal motives had
      their full share of influence at least with one, and perhaps with both.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the second battle of Behmus's Heights commenced, on the 7th of
      October, Arnold, having no command, was discovered to be in a state of
      high excitement and apparent irritation. He continued in camp for some
      time, but at length, without instructions or permission, rode off in a
      full gallop to the field of battle. This being told to Gates, he sent
      Major Armstrong after him with orders. As soon as Arnold saw Armstrong,
      anticipating the purport of his message, and doubtless remembering the
      peremptory order to return while on his way out to the former action, he
      put spurs to his horse and quickened his speed. Armstrong pursued, tracing
      the erratic movements of Arnold, and keeping up the chase for half an
      hour, without being able to approach near enough to speak to him. And in
      fact, Arnold received no orders during the day, but rode about the field
      in every direction, seeking the hottest parts of the action, and issuing
      his commands wherever he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being the highest officer in rank, that appeared on the field, his orders
      were obeyed when practicable; but all accounts agree, that his conduct was
      rash in the extreme, indicating rather the frenzy of a madman, than the
      considerate wisdom of an experienced general. He threw himself heedlessly
      into the most exposed situations, brandishing his sword in the air,
      animating his troops, and urging them forward. But the brilliant manouvre
      with which the engagement was closed, the assault of the enemy's works and
      driving the Hessians from their encampment, was undoubtedly owing in the
      first case to Arnold. He gave the order, and by his personal bravery set
      an example to the troops, which inspired them with ardor and hurried them
      onward. He was shot through the leg whilst riding gallantly into the
      sally-port, and his horse fell dead under him. The success of the assault
      was complete, and crowned the day with victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a curious fact, that an officer, who really had no command in the
      army, was the leader in one of the most spirited and important battles of
      the revolution. His madness, or rashness, or whatever it may be called,
      resulted most fortunately for himself. The wound he received, at the
      moment of rushing into the very arms of danger and of death, added fresh
      lustre to his military glory, and was a new claim to public favor and
      applause. In the heat of the action he struck an officer on the head with
      his sword, an indignity and offence, which might justly have been
      retaliated on the spot in the most fatal manner. The officer forbore; and
      the next day, when he demanded redress, Arnold declared his entire
      ignorance of the act, and expressed his regret. Some persons ascribed his
      wild temerity to intoxication, but Major Armstrong, who assisted in
      removing him from the field, was satisfied that this was not true. Others
      said he took opium. This is conjecture, unsustained by proofs of any kind,
      and consequently improbable. His vagaries may perhaps be sufficiently
      explained by the extraordinary circumstances of wounded pride, anger, and
      desperation, in which he was placed. Gates was not on the field, nor
      indeed did he leave his encampment during either of the battles of
      Behmus's Heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disabled by his wound, the bone of the leg being fractured, General Arnold
      was removed to Albany, where he stayed throughout the winter confined to
      his room. Congress relented, though with an ill grace at so late an hour,
      and authorized General Washington to send him a commission giving him the
      full rank he had claimed. This was accompanied with a letter in which
      Washington said, "As soon as your situation will permit, I request you
      will repair to this army, it being my earnest wish to have your services
      the ensuing campaign. In hopes of this, I have set you down in an
      arrangement now under consideration, and for a command, which, I trust,
      will be agreeable to yourself and of great advantage to the public." Early
      in the spring he went to Middletown in Connecticut, where he spent a month
      or two, and then proceeded to New Haven. His entrance into that town was
      marked with honorable demonstrations of respect for his military
      character. Several Continental and militia officers, a company under arms,
      and many of the citizens, went out to meet him on the road, and his
      arrival was announced by thirteen discharges of cannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at New Haven he received from General Washington a set of epaulettes
      and a sword-knot, with a letter stating that they were presented "as a
      testimony of sincere regard and approbation of his conduct." A gentleman
      in France had sent to General Washington three sets of epaulettes and
      sword-knots, requesting him to retain one for himself, and bestow the
      others on any gentlemen he might choose. The third set was given to
      General Lincoln.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>efore the end of
      May, Arnold joined the army at Valley Forge. It was daily expected, that
      the enemy would evacuate Philadelphia; and, as the condition of his wound
      did not permit him to perform an active part during the campaign,
      Washington had determined to appoint him to the command of that city, as
      soon as the British troops should leave it. This event occurred in a few
      days, and when the main army crossed the Delaware in pursuit of the
      retreating enemy, Arnold established his head-quarters in Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small regiment only of Continental troops with a few militia was
      attached to his command, and although in a military point of view the post
      had little responsibility, yet in other respects its duties were delicate
      and difficult. The enemy had held possession of the city for more than
      eight months, and in that period it had been the resort of many persons
      disaffected to the American cause; and indeed not a few of the most
      respectable inhabitants were known to be of very doubtful patriotism, if
      not wholly inclined to the interests of the King. Again, there was much
      merchandise in the city belonging to this description of persons, or at
      least possessing an equivocal character as to ownership, which would
      naturally open a door to disputes, if not to covert and fraudulent
      transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a still greater source of perplexity, and of ultimate mischief, was
      the indefinable nature of the powers, with which the commandant of the
      city was invested. How far did the military authority extend? What objects
      did it embrace, and in what particulars was it to take cognizance of the
      civil rights, condition, and acts of the people? Where was the line to be
      drawn between the control of the military commander, and that of the
      government of Pennsylvania, whose laws and orders the citizens were bound
      to obey? These questions could not be answered by precedent or rule; and
      the practical difficulties could be avoided only by a degree of prudence,
      which was not to be expected from the habits and temperament of Arnold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instructions to him from the Commander-in-chief were expressed in
      general terms, and the mode of discharging the duties of his new
      appointment was left mainly to his own discretion. By a resolve of
      Congress, the removal, transfer, and sale of all goods in the city were to
      be prevented, till a joint committee of that body and of the Council of
      Pennsylvania should ascertain whether any of the property belonged to the
      King of Great Britain or to his subjects. With the design of carrying this
      resolve into effect, Arnold, as soon as he entered the city, issued a
      proclamation prohibiting the sale of goods until the inquiry should be
      made according to the order of Congress. Although this measure was advised
      by the principal persons of the city, and was indeed necessary for the
      strict discharge of his duty, yet it appeared so arbitrary in its
      principles, and bore upon so large a portion of the community, that it was
      unpopular, and brought some degree of odium on its immediate author. It
      infused a prejudice and dislike into the minds of the people, which
      neither his disposition, the weight of his personal character, nor his
      manners, would be likely to remove. It was, to say the least, an
      unpropitious beginning of his command, and led the way to the unfortunate
      train of events that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold had been a month at Philadelphia, when he conceived the project of
      quitting the army, and entering into the naval service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wounds," said he, in writing to General Washington, "are in a fair
      way, and less painful than usual, though there is little prospect of my
      being able to take the field for a considerable time; which consideration,
      together with that of being obliged entirely to neglect my private affairs
      since I have been in the service, has induced me to wish to retire from
      public business, unless an offer, which my friends have mentioned, should
      be made to me of the command of the navy, to which my being wounded would
      not be so great an objection as it would to remaining in the army. I must
      beg leave to request your sentiments respecting a command in the navy. I
      am sensible of my inability, and of the great hazard and fatigue attending
      the office, and that I should enjoy much greater happiness in a retired
      life; but still my wishes to serve my country have a greater weight with
      me, than domestic happiness or ease."
    </p>
    <p>
      General Washington's reply was brief and cautious. He declined expressing
      an opinion or giving advice, saying that his ignorance of naval concerns
      rendered him an incompetent judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether there was a serious intention in any quarter to appoint Arnold to
      the command of the navy, or whether the idea originated with himself, and
      he wished to obtain the countenance of Washington in aid of his object, it
      would not be easy at this time to ascertain. The above extract from his
      own letter is probably the only record relative to the subject that can be
      found. His pecuniary embarrassments were now beginning to press upon him,
      at the moment when his extravagant habits of living made new demands, and
      his fondness for display was pampered by the adventitious consequence to
      which he was raised as commandant of Philadelphia. He soon discovered,
      that his means bore no proportion to his wants, and that his situation
      afforded him no facilities to increase the former, while it presented many
      temptations to multiply the latter. It may be presumed, therefore, that
      motives of gain, rather than of patriotism or honorable ambition, induced
      him to think of deserting the theatre of action, in which he had acquired
      so remarkable a celebrity, and of commencing a new career in another
      department, where his experience was limited, and his professional
      prospects were doubtful. In the command of the navy his ruling passion
      would be flattered with the alluring hope of profitable captures. This
      conjecture is strengthened by the fact, that he afterwards formed a
      resolution to take the command of a privateer, although he abandoned the
      scheme before he attempted to carry it into effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst so much that was mercenary, and so many derelictions of principle
      and faults of conduct, it is refreshing to discover some alleviating
      incidents. The lively interest expressed by Arnold in the orphan children
      of the lamented General Warren, who fell at Bunker's Hill, and the
      substantial tokens of kindness, which from time to time he rendered to
      them, would in any other person be regarded as noble proofs of
      disinterested benevolence and goodness of heart. Let them be placed in the
      scale, and allowed the weight they deserve. In what relation these two
      persons had stood to each other before the war is not known, but it is
      evident they were such as to inspire grateful recollections in the breast
      of Arnold.
    </p>
    <p>
      A name, made illustrious by patriotic ardor in the cause of his country
      and the sacrifice of his life on the altar of liberty, was the only
      inheritance left by Warren to four young children. Through the
      instrumentality of Samuel Adams, a resolve of Congress was passed, that
      the eldest son should be educated at the expense of the United States. It
      was presumed that the State of Massachusetts would provide for the other
      children. This latter expectation, however, was disappointed. The three
      younger children were put under the charge of Miss Mercy Scollay, of
      Boston, to whom Arnold wrote in the following terms, a few days after he
      took the command at Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About three months ago I was informed, said he, "that my late worthy
      friend General Warren left his affairs unsettled, and that, after paying
      his debts, a very small matter, if any thing, would remain for the
      education of his children, who, to my great surprise, I find have been
      entirely neglected by the State. Permit me to beg your continuing your
      care of the daughter, and that you will at present take charge of the
      education of the son. I make no doubt that his relations will consent that
      he shall be under your care. My intention is to use my interest with
      Congress to provide for the family. If they decline it, I make no doubt of
      a handsome collection by private subscription. At all events, I will
      provide for them in a manner suitable to their birth, and the grateful
      sentiments I shall ever feel for the memory of my friend. I have sent to
      you by Mr. Hancock five hundred dollars for the present. I wish you to
      have Richard clothed handsomely, and sent to the best school in Boston.
      Any expense you are at, please call on me for, and it shall be paid with
      thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      These generous sentiments were steadily maintained, and occasional
      supplies of money were forwarded according to the promise in this letter.
      He obtained private subscriptions, but apparently to no great amount. He
      made an application to Congress, which was referred to a committee, who
      reported, that the three younger children of General Warren should be
      maintained at the public expense in a manner suitable to their rank in
      life, till they should come of age, and at that time one thousand pounds
      should be given to each as a portion. If this report was ever called up,
      it did not receive the sanction of Congress. Arnold persevered, however,
      in his solicitation, and at last the point was carried to allow for the
      support of these children the half-pay of a major-general from the date of
      their father's death, till the youngest should be of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Warren had been dead five years, and the annual amount of half-pay
      was somewhat more than thirteen hundred dollars, making the sum due nearly
      seven thousand dollars besides the future stipend. In the congratulatory
      letter, which Arnold wrote to Miss Scollay on this event, only six weeks
      before the consummation of his treachery, he reiterated his ardent concern
      for the welfare of the children, but complained that his application to
      Congress had been opposed from the beginning by all the Massachusetts
      delegates except one. They looked upon the case as appertaining only to
      the State of Massachusetts, and as not coming within the jurisdiction of
      Congress. Others had the same opinion. The success of the measure, which
      every benevolent mind must heartily approve, may be fairly ascribed to the
      zeal and perseverance of Arnold.
    </p>
    <p>
      On various occasions, from the first week of his arrival in Philadelphia,
      he had contrived to involve himself in difficulties with the President and
      Council of Pennsylvania, which, at the end of seven months, had become so
      formidable and aggravated as to draw from that body a severe public
      censure upon his conduct. At a meeting of the board it was unanimously
      resolved, that the tenor and course of his military command in the city
      had been "in many respects oppressive, unworthy of his rank and station,
      highly discouraging to those who had manifested an attachment to the
      liberties and interests of America, and disrespectful to the supreme
      executive authority of the State." At the same time the attorney-general
      was authorized to prosecute him for such "illegal and oppressive acts, as
      were cognizable in the courts of law." To show the grounds of these
      proceedings, and to present the subject in a tangible form, the Council
      issued eight articles, or charges, containing an enumeration of his
      offensive acts. Some of these were set forth as of a criminal nature, and
      they all implied a wilful abuse of power, disregard of the rights of the
      people, or an unjustifiable interference with the government of
      Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Arnold being a United States' officer, it was deemed proper to
      make an appeal to Congress; and accordingly a list of the charges,
      accompanied by a letter from the President of Pennsylvania and divers
      other papers, was laid before that assembly. In the usual course of
      business these documents were referred to a committee of inquiry. The
      result was a vindication of General Arnold from any criminality in the
      matters charged against him. It appeared, however, that a misunderstanding
      existed between the committee and the Council, which prevented the latter
      from furnishing such testimony as was necessary to sustain their articles
      of censure. For this reason, probably, the report of the committee was not
      acted upon by Congress; but, in accordance with an agreement between the
      parties, the subject was referred anew to a joint committee of Congress
      and of the Assembly and Council of Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some progress had been made in the investigation, and the business
      was found to be clogged with many embarrassments, it was proposed by the
      Council, that the affair should be put into the hands of the
      Commander-in-chief, and submitted to a military tribunal. This
      arrangement, having been agreed to by the joint committee, was approved by
      Congress; but it was decided that four of the charges only were cognizable
      by a court-martial. These were transmitted to General Washington, who
      ordered a court to be convened, appointed the time of trial, and gave
      notice of the same to the respective parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this course Arnold was highly displeased, and he expressed himself in
      no measured terms of dissatisfaction, both in his letters to Congress and
      to General Washington. He affected to regard this disposition of the
      matter as a compromise between Congress and the authorities of
      Pennsylvania, and insinuated that he was sacrificed by the former to
      prevent a serious breach or collision with the latter. He complained of
      the injustice and partiality of Congress, in throwing aside the report of
      their own committee, by which he had been fully acquitted, and listening
      to the proposals of men, who, he said, were moved by personal enmity, and
      had practised unworthy artifices to cause delay. He acquiesced, however,
      and desired that the trial might be brought on as soon as possible,
      declaring his conviction, that justice would be rendered to him by a
      court-martial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council of Pennsylvania were not ready for the trial at the time first
      appointed by General Washington, and it was put off at their request to
      give them time to collect evidence. Arnold considered this a subterfuge
      and an additional grievance. More than three months had elapsed since the
      charges were presented to Congress, a space of time amply sufficient in
      his opinion for making every necessary preparation. The demand of a longer
      period he represented as a pretence to delay the trial, and to keep him
      under the odium of a public accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The form of the trial, as notified by the Commander-in-chief, was not
      acceptable to the Council. They were called on as the accusing party to
      defend their charges before the court-martial.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Reed wrote a letter to General Washington, in the name of the
      Council, expressing surprise that such a turn should be given to the
      affair, and that they should be looked upon in the light of the
      prosecuting party. He said it had never been their intention to exhibit
      charges, but only to convey their sense of the conduct of General Arnold,
      and to state their reasons. It was no part of their purpose to become
      prosecutors. Duty required them to make known their opinion to General
      Arnold's superiors and to the public, but farther than this they did not
      consider themselves bound to go. And, indeed, they conceived it to be
      inconsistent with the dignity of the executive authority of a state to
      appear before a military tribunal and prosecute an individual, who was
      amenable to another power for his conduct. They thought it the business of
      Congress, or of the Commander-in-chief, to institute a form of trial,
      which should put the prosecution upon a different footing. That the course
      of justice might not be obstructed, however, by points of etiquette or
      punctilious scruples, they professed a willingness to proceed with the
      trial, according to the mode appointed by the Commander-inchief,
      requesting only such delay as would enable them to procure the proper
      testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the committee of Congress had reported on the charges submitted
      by the Council of Pennsylvania, General Arnold resigned his command in
      Philadelphia. This occurred on the 18th of March, 1779. He had obtained
      permission of the Commander-in-chief to resign in January, but had
      deferred it, as he said in his letter to Congress, till the charges should
      be examined by that body, lest his enemies should misrepresent his
      motives, and ascribe his resignation to the fear of a disgraceful
      suspension in consequence of those charges. He was the more disappointed
      and vexed, therefore, that Congress, instead of calling up and sanctioning
      the report, yielded to the solicitation of his enemies for a military
      trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day finally agreed upon for the assembling of the court-martial was
      the 1st of June. Head-quarters were then at Middlebrook. Unfortunately
      just at that time the enemy in New York gave indications of a sudden
      movement, either into New Jersey, or up the North River; and a council of
      war decided, that the exigency of the service required every officer to be
      at his post, and rendered it necessary to defer the courtmartial, till, in
      the judgment of the Commander-in-chief, the state of affairs would permit
      the members to be assembled. This renewed disappointment was severely felt
      by Arnold, as there was now but a slender hope, that the trial could take
      place during the campaign; while he in the mean time would be destitute of
      employment, and his character must suffer from the suspicions excited in
      the public mind by the charges, which had been promulgated against him.
      Patience was his only resource; and, while practising this virtue so
      adverse to his habits, he had ample leisure to brood over his ills,
      cherish the bitter recollections of the past, and mature schemes for the
      future, which opened the way and hurried him onward to his ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether weary of a military life, or impelled by his pecuniary
      necessities, or from whatever cause, it appears that Arnold had actually
      meditated leaving the army before the difficulties with the Pennsylvania
      government had assumed the shape of a public censure upon his character.
      He had formed a project of obtaining a grant of land in the western part
      of New York, and of establishing a settlement for the officers and
      soldiers, who had served under him, and for such other persons as might
      choose to unite in the enterprise. The New York delegation in Congress
      approved his plan, and wrote a joint letter on the subject to Governor
      Clinton, soliciting his aid and counsel to obtain suitable patronage from
      the legislature. "To you, Sir," say they in the letter, "or to our State,
      General Arnold can require no recommendation; a series of distinguished
      services entitle him to respect and favor." They likewise represented, on
      general grounds, the policy of strengthening and guarding the frontier, by
      such a settlement as was contemplated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jay, then President of Congress, enforced the same application in a
      private letter to Governor Clinton, "How far his plan may coincide with
      the views of the legislature," he wrote, "I am at a loss to say. I wish,
      however, that in treating with him they may recollect the services he has
      rendered to his country, and the value of such a citizen to any state that
      may gain him. Several other general officers have thoughts of settling in
      our state, and the prevailing reason they assign for it is the preference
      of our constitution to that of other states. They consider it as having
      the principles of stability and vigor, as well as of liberty; advantages
      which the loose and less guarded kinds of government cannot promise. It
      certainly is our interest to encourage these predilections, by attention
      to those who hold them; and I have no doubt but that generosity to Arnold
      will be justice to the State." These testimonies show, that there was a
      division of opinion in Congress, and that Arnold numbered among his
      friends some of the ablest and best members. The spirit of party never
      raged with more violence within the walls of the old Congress, than at
      this period. Arnold's case was doubtless made worse, and his feelings
      irritated, by this circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He visited General Washington's camp in February, and it is supposed he
      extended his journey to the State of New York, and consulted Governor
      Clinton; but we hear no more of his project. It was absorbed at the time
      in the more engrossing concerns of his trial, and there was no subsequent
      opportunity for reviving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After resigning his command at Philadelphia, he continued to reside in
      that city, holding his commission in the army, but filling no public
      office. Either by the unpopularity of his character, or by his
      disagreeable manners, he rendered himself odious to the inhabitants, and
      one day when abroad he was assaulted by the populace. He immediately
      complained to Congress. "A mob of lawless ruffians," said he, "have
      attacked me in the street; and they threaten my life, now I am in my
      house, for defending myself when attacked. As there is no protection to be
      expected from the authority of the State for an honest man, I am under the
      necessity of requesting Congress to order me a guard of Continental
      troops. This request I presume will not be denied to a man, who has so
      often fought and bled in the defence of the liberties of his country." He
      asked for a guard of twenty men. Congress declined interfering, and
      referred him to the executive authority of Pennsylvania, not without a
      hint of displeasure at the insinuation in his note against the government
      of that State.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply he modified his meaning, and said he did not doubt the
      disposition of the executive of Pennsylvania to protect honest citizens,
      but he had no confidence in their ability to do it; since several persons
      had already been killed and wounded in an affray, notwithstanding the
      attempts of the civil authority to quell the disturbance. He renewed his
      request for a guard, and declared his belief, that his life was in danger
      from a mad, ignorant, and deluded rabble, whose rage and infatuation would
      drive them to any extreme of violence. As usual, he reminded Congress of
      his rank and services, and claimed to be protected by the troops, whom it
      had formerly been his happiness to command. This second application was
      unavailing, and he was left to such protection as he could obtain from the
      civil power of Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer and autumn passed away, and his trial was still in suspense. At
      length, when the campaign was closed, and the army had retired into
      winter-quarters, General Washington gave notice to the parties concerned,
      that a court-martial would be assembled on the 20th of December in the
      vicinity of Morristown. The trial was commenced at that place accordingly,
      and it continued, with some short intermissions, till the 26th of January,
      1780, when the court pronounced their verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several witnesses and much written testimony were patiently examined.
      Considering the grave purport of the charges, it must be allowed that the
      proofs, as they appear in the published proceedings, are not so clear and
      strong as might have been expected. Arnold's defence was studied,
      elaborate, and characteristic. He took up, one by one, the eight charges
      of the Council of Pennsylvania, although four of them only had been
      referred to the court, and attempted to refute them in detail. On some
      points he was successful, but, unfortunately for his cause, he weakened
      the force of his arguments and diminished the value of his facts, by
      making a parade of his patriotism, services, sacrifices, and wounds, and
      by enumerating his wrongs imaginary and real. He introduced letters from
      General Washington and resolves of Congress to show, that his conduct in
      the war had not only been approved but applauded, and thus aimed to draw
      the attention of the court aside from the true merits of the case by a
      series of particulars, which had no connexion with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the present necessary war against Great Britain commenced," said he,
      "I was in easy circumstances, and enjoyed a fair prospect of improving
      them. I was happy in domestic connexions, and blessed with a rising
      family, who claimed my care and attention. The liberties of my country
      were in danger. The voice of my country called on all her faithful sons to
      join in her defence. With cheerfulness I obeyed the call. I sacrificed
      domestic ease and happiness to the service of my country, and in her
      service have I sacrificed a great part of a handsome fortune. I was one of
      the first that appeared in the field, and from that time to the present
      hour I have not abandoned her service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When one is charged with practices, which his soul abhors, and which
      conscious innocence tells him he has never committed, an honest
      indignation will draw from him expressions in his own favor, which, on
      other occasions, might be ascribed to an ostentatious turn of mind. The
      part which I have acted in the American cause has been acknowledged by our
      friends and by our enemies to have been far from an indifferent one. My
      time, my fortune, and my person have been devoted to my country in this
      war; and, if the sentiments of those, who are supreme in the United States
      in civil and military affairs, are allowed to have any weight, my time, my
      fortune, and my person have not been devoted in vain." Again, in another
      part of his address to the court, after censuring his opponents, he added;&mdash;"On
      this occasion I think I may be allowed to say without vanity, that my
      conduct from the earliest period of the war to the present time has been
      steady and uniform. I have ever obeyed the calls of my country and stepped
      forth in her defence in every hour of danger, when many were deserting her
      cause, which appeared desperate. I have often bled in it; the marks that I
      bear are sufficient evidence of my conduct. The impartial public will
      judge of my services, and whether the returns I have met with are not
      tinctured with the basest ingratitude. Conscious of my own innocence, and
      the unworthy methods taken to injure me, I can with boldness say to my
      persecutors in general, and to the chief of them in particular, that in
      the hour of danger, when the affairs of America wore a gloomy aspect, when
      our illustrious General was retreating through New Jersey with a handful
      of men, I did not propose to my associates basely to quit the General and
      sacrifice the cause of my country to my personal safety, by going over to
      the enemy and making my peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boastfulness and malignity of these declarations are obvious enough,
      but their consummate hypocrisy can be understood only by knowing the fact,
      that, at the moment they were uttered, he had been eight months in secret
      correspondence with the enemy, and was prepared, if not resolved, when the
      first opportunity should offer, to desert and betray his country. No
      suspicions of such a purpose being entertained, these effusions were
      regarded as the offspring of vanity and the natural acerbity of his
      temper. They now afford a remarkable evidence of the duplicity of his
      character, and of the art with which he concealed the blackest schemes of
      wickedness under the guise of pretended virtue, and boast of immaculate
      innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the trial was finished, the court took due time to consider the
      testimony, and decided apparently without passion or bias. Of two charges
      he was wholly acquitted. The two others were sustained in part, but not so
      far as to imply, in the opinion of the court, a criminal intention. When
      Arnold was at Valley Forge, a short time before the evacuation of
      Philadelphia, he gave a written protection for a vessel then at that city
      to proceed to sea and enter any port within the United States. The vessel
      belonged to persons, who had taken the oath of allegiance to the State of
      Pennsylvania. Considering the circumstances of the case, and especially
      that the vessel was in a port held by the enemy, and that the protection
      was granted without the knowledge of the Commander-in-chief, who was then
      in camp, the proceeding was deemed irregular and at variance with one of
      the articles of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, while acting in his official station, General Arnold had employed
      the public wagons of Pennsylvania for the transportation of private
      property from Egg Harbor. This was looked upon as a serious offence by the
      Council, and as of a very dangerous tendency, since the demands for this
      kind of service in transporting supplies for the army were so constant and
      pressing, as to excite a good deal of repugnance to it in the minds of the
      people, by whom it must be performed; and, should they receive the
      impression that their efforts, ostensibly solicited for public objects,
      were secretly diverted to private purposes, it would be extremely
      difficult to secure them in times of necessity. On the other hand it was
      proved to the court, that, although the wagons had been employed for
      transporting private property, they were nevertheless used at private
      expense, without any design to defraud the public, or impede the military
      service. The court were of the opinion, however, that, considering the
      high station in which General Arnold acted at the time, and the effect of
      his requests under the circumstances in which he was placed, the
      transaction was imprudent and improper.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these grounds, and with reference to these two charges only, the Court
      sentenced him to be reprimanded by the Commander-in-chief.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he decision of the
      court-martial was received with an ill grace by General Arnold, and with
      concealed emotions of deep resentment. He had loudly expressed a
      conviction, and perhaps he had actually persuaded himself into a belief,
      that a military tribunal would acquit him honorably of all the charges. In
      the same degree, that he had allowed himself to be flattered with this
      sanguine anticipation, was the rankling of the wound now inflicted on his
      self-complacency and pride. He submitted to the reprimand, however, in
      sullen reserve and with a pretended acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Washington, in performing the duty imposed on him as the head of
      the army, exercised all the delicacy, which he thought due to an officer
      so highly distinguished by his rank and bravery, and which was likewise
      conformable to his own character and feelings. The language employed on
      the occasion, as preserved by M. de Marbois, was as follows. "Our
      profession is the chastest of all. The shadow of a fault tarnishes our
      most brilliant actions. The least inadvertence may cause us to lose that
      public favor, which is so hard to be gained. I reprimand you for having
      forgotten, that, in proportion as you had rendered yourself formidable to
      our enemies, you should have shown moderation towards our citizens.
      Exhibit again those splendid qualities, which have placed you in the rank
      of our most distinguished generals. As far as it shall be in my power, I
      will myself furnish you with opportunities for regaining the esteem, which
      you have formerly enjoyed." Terms more soothing, or better suited to
      operate on a noble and generous mind, could hardly be chosen. But they had
      no effect on the irritated and relentless temper of Arnold. He was equally
      deaf to the counsels of wisdom, the admonitions of friendship, and the
      appeals of honor. He had already made secret advances to the enemy under a
      feigned name, intending to square his future conduct according to
      circumstances, and prepared, should the court decide against him, to seek
      revenge at any hazard. From the moment he harbored such a thought in his
      breast he was a lost man. Honor, virtue, sincerity, love of country, love
      of fame, all were gone. His companionship was with despair and guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dissembling his real motives, after being restored to his former standing
      in the army, he asked permission of absence during the summer, assigning
      as a reason, that his private affairs were deranged and required his
      attention, that there was little prospect of an active campaign, and that
      his wounds were not yet in a condition to enable him to endure the
      fatigues of the field. Washington readily granted his request, and he
      returned to Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time he took the command in that city he had lived in a style of
      splendor and extravagance, which was wholly unsuited to his fortune or any
      reasonable expectancy. He established himself in a magnificent house,
      formerly occupied by the Penn family, furnished it expensively, drove his
      coach and four, and indulged in every kind of ostentatious profusion,
      which could gratify his vanity and his passion for luxury and parade. When
      M. Gerard, the French ambassador, first arrived in Philadelphia, he was
      entertained at a public dinner given by General Arnold; and, for several
      days afterwards, the ambassador and his suite occupied apartments as
      guests in his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style of living could not be maintained without funds. Debts were
      contracted, and temporary supplies were thus procured; but a declining
      credit soon produced a conviction of improvidence, and excited
      forebodings, which even Arnold could not contemplate with unconcern. Too
      proud to acknowledge his folly by abandoning it, and too desperate to be
      governed by the plain rules of integrity or prudence, he resorted to all
      the methods for acquiring money, which his ingenuity could devise or his
      high station put in his power. Among these were some by no means
      creditable to his principles, or consistent with his rank as an officer.
      He entered into petty speculations and practised unworthy artifices for
      gain in small matters as well as great. He united with others in
      privateering enterprises and various commercial projects of hazard. The
      results were frequently unfortunate, and the losses outweighed the
      profits. On one occasion, when Count d'Estaing approached the American
      coast, and it was supposed the British would be driven from New York, he
      formed a copartnership with two other individuals for purchasing goods
      within the enemy's lines, to the amount of thirty thousand pounds
      sterling. Although there was nothing positively wrong in this transaction,
      yet it was one in which a major-general of the American service, holding
      at that time an important command, could not be reputably engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of his embarrassments, about a month after his trial, he
      renewed a petition to Congress for a settlement of his accounts. These had
      already been referred to commissioners, who made a report; and the
      accounts were then sent to the Treasury Board for settlement. The original
      difficulties, however, were not removed. Arnold insisted on his old
      claims, quarrelled with the members of Congress who doubted them, and
      wearied the others with his importunities and complaints, till his enemies
      were provoked and disgusted at his effrontery, and the patience of his
      friends was worn out. Indeed, the affair had grown into such a state of
      perplexity, that the prospect of a satisfactory termination was more
      clouded, and seemed more distant, than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already abandoned to the impulse of passion, disappointed, chagrined, and
      pressed by his wants, he resolved to unburden his griefs to the French
      envoy, M. de la Luzerne, and apply to him for pecuniary aid. That
      minister, having an admiration of his bravery and military talents, and
      believing generous usage the best means of reclaiming such a man from his
      errors, was accustomed to treat him with marked civility, and had shown no
      change in his deportment after the censure of the court-martial and the
      disgrace of a reprimand. Encouraged by this amenity and kindness, Arnold
      approached him with confidence, and expressed his sentiments and wishes
      without reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview has been described with graphic minuteness by M. de Marbois,
      who was then secretary to the French legation, and who, if he was not
      present, must have learned the particulars from the minister himself.
      Arnold spoke of his disinterested services, his sacrifices, his wounds; he
      complained of the ingratitude of his country, the injustice of Congress,
      and the persecuting malice of his enemies. The war, he said, in which he
      had borne so large a share, had ruined his private affairs; and he added,
      that, unless he could borrow money to the amount of his debts, he should
      be obliged to go into retirement, and quit a profession, which rewarded
      him only with poverty. He intimated, in short, that it would be for the
      interest of the French King to secure the attachment and gratitude of an
      American general so high in rank, and that these might be purchased by the
      favor of such a loan as he desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister listened to this discourse with pain, but he answered with
      the frankness of a true friend, and the firmness of an honorable and
      honest mind. "You desire of me a service," said he, "which it would be
      easy for me to render, but which would degrade us both. When the envoy of
      a foreign power gives, or, if you will, lends money, it is ordinarily to
      corrupt those who receive it, and to make them the creatures of the
      sovereign, whom he serves; or rather he corrupts without persuading; he
      buys and does not secure. But the firm league entered into between the
      King and the United States is the work of justice and of the wisest
      policy. It has for its basis a reciprocal interest and good-will. In the
      mission, with which I am charged, my true glory consists in fulfilling it
      without intrigue or cabal, without resorting to any secret practices, and
      by the force alone of the conditions of the alliance." The effect of this
      plainness of speech upon the haughty and irritable temper of Arnold may be
      imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      But M. de la Luzerne did not content himself with refusing to give the
      bribe, and condemning the principles from which such a request emanated.
      He hoped to do more, and to win back to the path of duty and rectitude a
      man, who, by the force of his own resources and talents, had built up a
      reputation that had gained the applause of the world, and who was still
      capable of rendering important services to his country. With this view he
      addressed him in the language of expostulation and advice, reminding him
      that murmurs and resentments at the acts of public bodies, and the
      persecutions of political opponents, were the evidences of a weak rather
      than of a great mind resting on its own dignity and power; that a
      consciousness of innocence was his best support; and that a generous
      disregard of the artifices of his enemies, when his country's interests
      were at stake, was one of the strongest proofs he could give, that he
      deserved the respect and confidence of that portion of his fellow
      citizens, whose good opinion was most to be valued. He recurred to the
      renown of his former exploits, appealed to his sense of patriotism and
      honor, his love of glory, and represented in the most attractive colors
      the wide field of action yet before him, if he would suppress his anger,
      rise above misfortune, bear his troubles with fortitude, and unite, heart
      and hand, with his compatriots to finish the great work, in which he had
      already labored with so much credit to himself and benefit to his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      These counsels had no weight with Arnold; he wanted money and not advice.
      He went away from the French minister indignant at the rebuff he had met
      with, mortified at his ill success, and, if his sensibility was not
      callous, oppressed with shame at so unguarded and ineffectual an exposure
      of his meanness. From that moment his purpose was fixed. Hitherto his
      intercourse with the enemy, though of several months' continuance, had
      been without a definite aim; clothed in such a shape, that it might be
      consummated or dropped according to the complexion of future events. The
      point was now reached, at which it was hopeless to deliberate, and
      pusillanimous to waver. Pride, vexation, revenge, hurried him to the fatal
      determination of betraying his country, as the last refuge of despair. It
      only remained for him to settle in his mind the manner in which this could
      so be done, as to produce the greatest advantage to himself, and injury to
      the cause he was about to desert. It was obvious, that the favor he might
      expect from his new friends would be in proportion to the harm he should
      do to their enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this train of reflection he thought of the command at West Point, as
      presenting the fairest opportunity for accomplishing his ends. It was a
      separate command, a very important post, and accessible to the enemy by
      water. His resolution being taken, all his views and efforts thenceforward
      were directed to that single object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another circumstance should be mentioned, which probably had a large share
      among the original causes of the defection of Arnold. When the British
      evacuated Philadelphia, many families remained behind, who had kept up
      close intimacies with the British officers, and who were known to be
      disaffected to the American cause. Prominent in this class, both for
      respectability and attachment to the old order of things, was the family
      of Mr. Edward Shippen, afterwards Chief Justice of the State of
      Pennsylvania. His youngest daughter, at that time under the age of
      eighteen, was beautiful, gay, attractive, and ambitious. She had been
      admired and flattered by the British officers, and was a conspicuous
      personage at the gorgeous festival of the <i>Mischianza</i>, an
      entertainment given by them in honor of Sir William Howe, on the occasion
      of his resigning the command of the army and departing for Europe. Her
      acquaintance with André was on so familiar a footing, that she
      corresponded with him after the British army had retired to New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold had not been many weeks in Philadelphia, before he was smitten with
      the charms of this lady, and sought her hand. Captivated with the splendor
      in which he lived, with his equipage and military display, her heart
      yielded to the impulse of youthful vanity and an aspiring ambition. His
      addresses were favorably received, and he married her. In addition to the
      biases of his wife, this alliance brought him into perpetual contact with
      persons, who had no sympathy with the friends of liberty, the advocates of
      independence, the defenders of their country's rights, but who, on the
      contrary, condemned their acts, and secretly hoped, that the power of the
      British King would crush all opposition and again predominate.
    </p>
    <p>
      People of this stamp were ready enough to minister fuel to the flame, that
      burned in the breast of a passionate, soured, and discontented man, who
      had attained to so high a degree of consequence in the ranks of the
      opposite party.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would not fail to encourage his discontent by aggravating its causes,
      by persuading him that he was neglected and ill-treated, that his services
      were undervalued, and that he had good reason for his complaints of
      ingratitude, injustice, and persecution. Such discourse, often repeated in
      his ears, and harmonizing with his impressions, would gradually give a
      current to his thoughts, and help to undermine the tottering fabric of his
      good resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having formed his plan, he applied himself assiduously to the means of
      putting it in execution. As he had requested permission of absence from
      the army during the campaign, at the time of his trial, it was necessary
      to give some plausible reason for changing his mind. Hitherto he had not
      ceased to talk about his wounds, and to represent that these disabled him
      from taking an active part; but now he said his wounds were fast
      recovering, and, although he could not endure the fatigues of the field on
      horseback, yet a command requiring little bodily action, like that at West
      Point, he thought he could very well sustain; and his eagerness to rejoin
      his companions in arms, and render his country all the service in his
      power, prompted him to make every sacrifice of ease and comfort, which was
      not absolutely forbidden by the state of his health. Such was the language
      with which he approached his friends in Congress, who had adhered to him
      through all his troubles, and whom he knew to have influence with the
      Commander-in-chief, particularly General Schuyler and the other New York
      delegates.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was known, by the arrival of the Marquis de Lafayette in
      Philadelphia, about the middle of May, that a French army of cooperation
      was coming to the United States, the quick foresight of Arnold pointed out
      to him the facilities, which this circumstance might afford for the
      execution of his project. He became the more anxious to have the affair in
      a proper train. General Schuyler was then shortly to proceed to camp, as
      one of a committee from Congress to consult and act in matters relating to
      the army; and Arnold intimated to him, that the command at West Point
      would be the best suited to his present condition. General Schuyler
      likewise received a letter from him a few days after his arrival in camp,
      stating a determination to join the army, and hinting at West Point, but
      not in such a manner as to betray solicitude; on the contrary, he said
      that he supposed General Heath would command there, unless some other
      arrangement should be made agreeable to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the further progress of this design, and upon the same principles of
      caution, he prevailed on Mr. Robert R. Livingston, then a member of
      Congress from New York, to write to Washington, and suggest the expediency
      of appointing him to West Point. Mr. Livingston stated, that he stood high
      in the estimation of the people of New York, was very popular with the
      militia, whose services would probably be wanted in the course of the
      campaign, and was moreover an officer of tried courage and ability. His
      application had no appearance of being made at the instance of General
      Arnold, but seemed to flow from Mr. Livingston's own views of the
      importance of the post and the wisdom of such an appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far every thing had gone on as smoothly as could be desired. The way
      was fairly open; no undue concern had been shown, and no suspicions
      excited. Mr. Livingston's letter was followed immediately by Arnold in
      person, who, under pretence of having private business in Connecticut,
      passed through the camp on his route, and called at the quarters of the
      Commander-inchief. By his manner and conversation he seemed to have no
      special object, but that of paying his respects, and incidentally
      expressed his desire of joining the army. Washington replied, that the
      campaign would probably be active, and that, if the condition of his
      wounds would permit, he should be extremely glad of his services. Arnold
      then said, that he did not think the state of his wounds such as to allow
      him to perform a very active part, yet he repeated his wish to be united
      again with the army. From the beginning to the end of the interview no
      allusion was made to West Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pursued his journey to Connecticut, and when returning he again called
      on General Washington. The same subject was introduced, and to the same
      effect; till Arnold at last intimated, that, as he was disabled to do
      active duty, the command at West Point would probably be better adapted to
      him than any other. Washington was a little surprised, that a man so
      remarkable for energy and action should seek a post, in which there was
      comparatively so little to be done, and told him frankly, that he could
      hardly believe the place would suit him, for it would be covered by the
      main army towards New York, and thus would need only a small garrison.
      Nothing more was said on the subject. Arnold left the camp, and, after
      visiting West Point, and examining every part of the works in company with
      General Howe, who then commanded there, he went back to Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no sooner arrived, than he wrote to Congress reminding them that
      four years' pay was due to him, and requesting the amount of four months'
      pay to be furnished, with which he might purchase horses and
      camp-equipage, and thereby be enabled to take the field. Whether Congress
      ever paid any part of this claim, or took any notice of the request, I
      know not, as the journals are silent concerning the matter. There is a
      private letter, however, written by him after he had joined the army, in
      which he complained, that the public were indebted to him for four years'
      pay and a considerable sum of money advanced by him in Canada. This was
      only a repetition of the old grievance; and whatever may have been the
      extent or justice of his accounts, as represented by himself, it does not
      appear that they were ever settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was known to Sir Henry Clinton, that the French troops had arrived
      at Newport, he formed a plan for attacking them before they could land and
      fortify themselves. Intelligence of the preparatory movements for this
      enterprise was instantly communicated to General Washington by his spies
      in New York. His army was then encamped on the west side of Hudson's
      River, and he immediately put it in motion to cross the river, with the
      intention to march down the east side, menace New York in the absence of
      Sir Henry Clinton, and even attack it, should his force prove sufficient.
      Arnold reached the camp on the last day of July, while the army was
      crossing the river at King's Ferry. He first met General Washington riding
      to see the last division over, and asked if any place had been assigned to
      him. The General replied, that he was to command the left wing, which was
      a post of honor and to which he was entitled by his rank. At these words
      his countenance fell, and he showed a manifest disappointment, but said
      nothing. The General desired him to go to his quarters, where he would
      soon meet him, and have further conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving there he ascertained from Colonel Tilghman, one of his aids,
      that Arnold had been talking with him on the subject, and seemed
      dissatisfied and uneasy, alleging his inability to perform proper service
      in the field, or to remain long on horseback, in consequence of his
      wounded leg, and speaking of West Point as the only post at which he could
      do justice to himself or be useful to the army. This behavior, so
      inconsistent with all that was known of the character of the man, struck
      Washington as strange and unaccountable. He had appointed him to the left
      wing of the army, because it was a responsible station, requiring an able
      and efficient officer, and he believed no one could fill it better,
      especially as there was a prospect of fighting, in which branch of the
      service Arnold stood preeminent for courage, skill, and good conduct. He
      could not conceive, therefore, how such a man, in the heat of a stirring
      campaign, could wish to be confined to a garrison, where there was little
      scope for his military talents, no room for enterprise, no chance for
      action; and it would seem all along as if he did not regard the hints
      about the command at West Point as uttered in sober earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now convinced, however, that Arnold really wished for that command;
      and, as the news of Sir Henry Clinton's having abandoned his plan and
      debarked his troops quickly arrived, and the further march of the army was
      thereby rendered unnecessary, and the time of active operations uncertain,
      he resolved to comply with his request, and to appoint another officer to
      the place designed for him in the main army. The instructions were dated
      at Peekskill, on the 3d of August; and Arnold repaired without delay to
      the Highlands and established his head-quarters at Robinson's House, two
      or three miles below West Point on the opposite or eastern bank of the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the army retraced its steps, and, crossing the Hudson again at
      King's Ferry, moved down towards Hackensac, and encamped with the centre
      at Orangetowm, or Tappan, the left wing resting on the river near Dobbs's
      Ferry, and the right extending into the country. In this position the army
      remained for several weeks. The right was commanded by General Greene, the
      left by Lord Stirling; and the Light Infantry, a body of selected troops
      consisting of six battalions, was stationed in advance of the main army
      under the command of the Marquis de Lafayette.
    </p>
    <p>
      A characteristic incident occurred, when Arnold was about leaving the army
      to proceed to the Highlands. He went to Lafayette and suggested that, as
      he had spies in New York employed at his own expense, their intelligence
      might often reach him more expeditiously by the way of West Point; and
      requested that the names and address of those spies might be entrusted to
      him, by which means he should be enabled to facilitate the intercourse.
      Lafayette objected to the proposal upon the principle, that he was bound
      in honor and conscience not to reveal the names of his spies to any
      person; but it was not till after the developement of Arnold's treachery,
      that he perceived his drift in making the request.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Progress of the Conspiracy on the Part of the British Commander.&mdash;Major
      John André.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>lthough the
      correspondence with the enemy had been kept up nearly eighteen months, it
      had always been under fictitious names by both parties. The epistolary
      intercourse between Major André and Mrs. Arnold, begun before her marriage
      and continued after that event, afforded a convenient medium of
      communication, which Arnold could turn to his purpose without exciting the
      suspicions even of his wife. His advances were made directly to Sir Henry
      Clinton, through the hands of Major André; and in this channel the
      correspondence was conducted to the end. André had the entire confidence
      of his commander, and was for a time his aid-de-camp, till raised to a
      higher station. He affixed to his letters the signature of <i>John
      Anderson</i>, and Arnold assumed the name of <i>Gustavus</i>. They also
      wrote in a disguised hand, and used other devices to prevent detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without giving any certain clew to his name, rank, or character, Arnold
      expressed in his first letters a dissatisfaction with the French alliance,
      and touched upon other topics in such a manner as he thought would please
      the British commander and attract his attention. He likewise sent
      intelligence, which proved to be correct and important. The same was
      repeated at different times, till at length General Clinton's curiosity
      was awakened, and he employed every method in his power to ascertain the
      identity of the person, who was opening himself thus freely, and
      furnishing information of the greatest value. It was obvious, from the
      nature of his communications, that he was a person of consequence, who had
      a knowledge of the secret springs of American affairs, and was on terms of
      intimacy with the leaders. To prevent the possibility of detection,
      however, should his letters fall into other hands than those for which
      they were intended, the language was extremely guarded in every thing that
      related to the situation or person of the writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after putting together and weighing a variety of circumstances,
      Sir Henry Clinton was satisfied, that his hidden correspondent was General
      Arnold. He had no positive proof, but the evidence was so conclusive in
      his own mind, that the correspondence was continued upon that supposition.
      This discovery was not made, or rather this conviction was not settled
      till subsequently to Arnold's trial by a court-martial; and being then
      under a sort of disgrace, and not likely again to be employed, the British
      commander did not look upon him to be of so much importance, whatever
      might have been his military merits, that it was an object worthy of his
      attention to bring him over merely as an officer of rank. On the contrary,
      believing him to be more useful as a correspondent where he was, than he
      would be when joined to the British army, no tempting encouragements were
      held out to hasten his desertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things remained in this posture for some time, when the person wrote, that
      he should certainly be soon employed again in the American service, and
      made a direct offer to surrender himself, and in such a manner as to
      contribute every possible advantage to his Majesty's arms. In a few days
      Arnold took the command at West Point, and the affair then assumed a
      magnitude and an interest, which it had not hitherto possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Clinton now saw a prospect before him, and an opening for a
      successful operation, which claimed his immediate and assiduous care. To
      get possession of West Point and its dependent posts, with their
      garrisons, military stores, cannon, vessels, boats, and provisions,
      appeared to him an object of such vast importance, that in attaining it no
      reasonable hazard or expense ought to be spared. In the first place, it
      would bring under his control the navigable waters of Hudson's River, and
      in some degree facilitate his intercourse with the army in Canada, as well
      as essentially derange the communication of the Americans between the
      eastern and middle States. But other results, of much greater consequence,
      might be anticipated by taking into view the condition of affairs at the
      present stage of the campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      A French fleet and army, under the command of the Chevalier de Ternay and
      Count de Rochambeau, had recently arrived in Rhode Island, and were ready
      to cooperate with the Americans in an attack upon the British, whenever a
      favorable opportunity should offer. Washington's army had been augmented,
      and was gaining strength daily by new enlistments and the temporary
      service of the militia. Many reasons induced Sir Henry Clinton to believe,
      that an attempt was intended against New York, as soon as a union could be
      concerted between the commanders of the two allied forces. The information
      derived from his spies and the Tories confirmed this belief. It was
      rumored, that Washington would move upon Kingsbridge and Morrisania, while
      a detachment would menace or perhaps attack Staten Island, and the French
      invade Long Island and approach the city in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      To execute such a scheme, it would be necessary for the Americans to
      collect and deposit in some place large magazines of provisions and
      military stores. Both from its position and its strength, West Point would
      undoubtedly be chosen for the depot of these supplies. On this ground
      alone, therefore, it was an object of the greatest importance with the
      British commander to pursue any plan, which held out a promise to put him
      in possession of that post. Such an event would not only defeat the
      project of a combined attack, but distress both the opposing armies to
      such a degree, by depriving them of supplies, that it would cause
      disaffection and desertion in the American ranks, and excite a spirit of
      discontent if not disgust among the French. When these bearings of the
      subject are taken into view, it is no wonder that Sir Henry Clinton should
      be extremely desirous to effect a purpose, which would crown the campaign
      with triumphant success, and be of such immense advantage to the King's
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      His original idea for executing the plan was, that every thing should be
      in readiness to act when the two allied armies should begin their
      movements towards New York, and after the magazines had all been gathered
      into the depots on Hudson's River. If the posts and garrisons had been
      surrendered at this moment, it would have deranged and frustrated the
      operations of the allies. Washington must have instantly retreated from
      Kingsbridge. The French troops on Long Island would have been left
      unsupported, and must either have retired precipitately to their ships, or
      more probably have fallen into the hands of the British.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Sir Henry Clinton kept the affair a profound secret to himself
      and two or three officers, yet all the requisite preparations were made.
      The troops were so posted that they could be put in motion at the shortest
      notice, and vessels of suitable dimensions and properly manned were ready.
      While things were in this train, the important news of the defeat of
      General Gates in South Carolina reached New York. It was questionable at
      first what course Washington would pursue in consequence of this
      intelligence. It was supposed, that he would detach a part of his army to
      the south, and thus change the aspect of the campaign at the north. He was
      carefully watched by the spies; and it was ascertained, that he did not
      send a man to the southward, nor make any apparent alteration in his
      previous plans. It was inferred, that New York was still his object, and
      this inference was rendered certain by communications from General Arnold.
      The events, which immediately followed, will be best described in the
      words of Sir Henry Clinton, as contained in one of his letters to Lord
      George Germain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At this period," said he, "Sir George Rodney arrived with a fleet at New
      York, which made it highly probable, that Washington would lay aside all
      thoughts against this place. It became therefore proper for me no longer
      to defer the execution of a project, which would lead to such considerable
      advantages, nor to lose so fair an opportunity as was presented, and under
      so good a mask as an expedition to the Chesapeake, which every body
      imagined would of course take place. Under this feint I prepared for a
      movement up the North River. I laid my plan before Sir George Rodney and
      General Knyphausen, when Sir George, with that zeal for his Majesty's
      service, which marks his character, most handsomely promised to give me
      every naval assistance in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It became necessary at this instant, that the secret correspondence under
      feigned names, which had been so long carried on, should be rendered into
      certainty, both as to the person being General Arnold commanding at West
      Point, and that in the manner in which he was to surrender himself, the
      forts, and troops to me, it should be so conducted under a concerted plan
      between us, as that the King's troops sent upon this expedition should be
      under no risk of surprise or counterplot; and I was determined not to make
      the attempt but under such particular security.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew the ground on which the forts were placed, and the contiguous
      country, tolerably well, having been there in 1777; and I had received
      many hints respecting both from General Arnold. But it was certainly
      necessary that a meeting should be held with that officer for settling the
      whole plan. My reasons, as I have described them, will, I trust, prove the
      propriety of such a measure on my part. General Arnold had also his
      reasons, which must be so very obvious, as to make it unnecessary for me
      to explain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many projects for a meeting were formed, and consequently several
      attempts made, in all of which General Arnold seemed extremely desirous,
      that some person, who had my particular confidence, might be sent to him;
      some man, as he described it in writing, <i>of his own mensuration</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had thought of a person under this important description, who would
      gladly have undertaken it, but that his peculiar situation at the time,
      from which I could not release him, prevented him from engaging in it.
      General Arnold finally insisted, that the person sent to confer with him
      should be Adjutant-General Major André, who indeed had been the person on
      my part, who managed and carried on the secret correspondence."
    </p>
    <p>
      From these facts it appears, that André did not himself propose to
      undertake this mission, nor engage in it voluntarily, but yielded to the
      wishes of Sir Henry Clinton in conformity with the express solicitation of
      Arnold. Although this circumstance does not affect the nature of
      subsequent transactions, yet in its bearing on the character and motives
      of André it is worthy of remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parents of André were originally of Geneva. From that place they
      removed to London, where this son was born. He was sent early in life to
      Geneva for his education, but he returned to London before he was eighteen
      years old. Being designed for the mercantile profession, he entered the
      counting-house of a respectable establishment in London, where he
      continued at least three or four years. During this period he formed an
      ardent attachment for a young lady, which was reciprocated; but the
      marriage was defeated by the opposition of the lady's father. The strength
      of his passion for her is described in glowing colors, and with much
      enthusiasm of feeling, in his interesting letters written at the time to
      Miss Seward. She is there called <i>Honora</i>. Four years after the
      engagement had been dissolved by parental authority, she was married to
      another person. Till that time André had cherished the delusive fancy,
      that some propitious event would change the current of his fortunes, and
      crown his wishes with success. Despair had now shut the door of hope. The
      following lines, from Miss Seward's poetical tribute to his memory, allude
      to this incident.

    <p class="indent30">
      "While the fair-one's sighs

    <p class="indent15">
      Disperse, like April storms in sunny skies,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

      Till hovering Rumor chased the pleasing dream,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And veiled with raven-wing the silver beam."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment André became disgusted with his pursuits, and resolved to
      seek relief from his bitter associations, and dissipate the memory of his
      sorrows, in the turmoil and dangers of war. He joined the British army in
      Canada, with a lieutenant's commission, and was taken prisoner at the
      capture of St. John's by General Montgomery in the autumn of 1775. He was
      sent with other prisoners to Lancaster, in Pennsylvania, where he remained
      a few months till he was exchanged. Not long afterwards he said, in a
      letter to a friend, "I have been taken prisoner by the Americans, and
      stripped of every thing except the picture of Honora, which I concealed in
      my mouth. Preserving that, I yet think myself fortunate." The picture had
      been delineated from the living features of the object of his affection by
      his own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a graceful and handsome person, André added many accomplishments of
      mind and manners. He was passionately fond of the fine arts, and had
      attained very considerable skill in drawing and painting. A journal of his
      travels and campaigns in America, which he kept from the time of his first
      arrival in Canada, contained lively and picturesque sketches of the
      people, their dresses, houses, and other objects, illustrating the habits
      of life, customs, and amusements of the Canadians, Americans, and Indians;
      and also drawings of animals, birds, insects, trees, and plants, each in
      its appropriate colors. Landscapes, views, and plans of places were
      interspersed, and connected by a narrative and written descriptions. This
      journal was seen and perused in Philadelphia, while the British had
      possession of that city. To a taste for poetry he united a love of elegant
      letters, and his attainments in the various branches of literature were
      extensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      His epistolary writings, so far as specimens of them have been preserved,
      show a delicacy of sentiment, a playfulness of imagination, and an ease of
      style, which could proceed only from native refinement and a high degree
      of culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      These attractions, connected with an affable deportment, and the address
      of a perfect gentleman, gained him ready access to all circles, and won
      the hearts of numerous friends. A favorite in the army, and everywhere
      admired in the walks of social life, his merits were soon discovered by
      those, who had power to reward them. Unaided by any other recommendation,
      than that of his own character, he was received into the military family
      of Major General Grey as aid-de-camp, soon after his release from
      captivity. In this station he remained till General Grey returned to
      Europe, when he was transferred to the same post in the family of Sir
      Henry Clinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the confidence, and the respect for his talents, which he
      inspired in Sir Henry Clinton, that, when a vacancy occurred in the office
      of adjutant-general by the resignation of Lord Raw-don, he appointed André
      to fill the place at the head of the department. André was now only a
      captain in the service, and, the rank of major being requisite for an
      adjutant-general, Sir Henry Clinton wrote to the minister on the subject,
      and requested that he might accordingly be promoted. The minister declined
      complying with the solicitation, on the ground that André was too young an
      officer for such an elevation. In reply, General Clinton intimated
      surprise and a little displeasure, that his request should be thus turned
      aside; and said he could not fix his choice on any other person so
      suitable for the office, and therefore he should continue to employ André
      to discharge its duties, and should forbear for the present to make any
      other appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This representation was successful. The rank of major was conferred on
      André, and Sir Henry Clinton then applied in form to have him commissioned
      by the King, as adjutant-general of the army in America. The letter
      containing his application was dated only three weeks preceding the
      capture of André. Hence he did not receive the commission before his
      death, although he had for nearly a year filled the office of
      adjutant-general.

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Various Schemes for effecting an Interview between Arnold and André.&mdash;Their
      Meeting within the American Lines.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter it had been
      decided, that André should go out and meet Arnold, various plans were
      devised for bringing about the interview in a manner, which should not
      excite suspicion. As Arnold had no associate, but kept his designs closely
      concealed within his own breast, the management of the affair on his part
      was extremely delicate and difficult, and required consummate address. It
      was absolutely necessary that there should be intermediate agents,
      ignorant not only of his purposes, but of the tendency of their own acts.
      Every thing must seem to be done openly and for the public good, and the
      actors must at least suppose themselves to be engaged in an honorable
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      In writing to André under the fictitious name of <i>Gustavus</i>, on the
      30th of August, Arnold told him that he expected soon to procure an
      interview, when, said he, "you will be able to settle your commercial plan
      I hope agreeably to both parties." Alluding to himself in the third
      person, he went on to say, "He is still of opinion, that his first
      proposal is by no means unreasonable, and makes no doubt, when he has a
      conference with you, that you will close with it. He expects when you
      meet, that you will be fully authorized from your house; that the risks
      and profits of the copartnership may be fully and clearly understood. A
      speculation might at this time be easily made to some advantage with <i>ready
      money</i>." In this disguise of a pretended mercantile transaction he
      escaped the chance of detection, and made known by hints, that could not
      be mistaken, what he expected as the reward of his perfidy. As Sir Henry
      Clinton determined to risk nothing, till he should have all the security
      which the nature of the case admitted, so Arnold resolved to keep the
      matter in his own hands, till a definite sum of money should be agreed
      upon and promised, and all the preliminaries on that head settled. This
      could be done only by a personal arrangement between Arnold himself, and
      some individual deputed for the purpose by the British commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold's first plan was to receive André within the lines, and even at his
      own head-quarters, as a person devoted to the American interests, who had
      the means of procuring important intelligence from the enemy, and was
      disposed from patriotic motives to take some hazards in promoting so
      valuable an end. And here it may be observed, that this was a ground on
      which Arnold might proceed with safety, inasmuch as it was well known in
      the army, that the commanders resorted to every practicable mode of
      procuring intelligence, and employed secret agents in that service. Under
      this guise, therefore, all the preliminaries of a meeting with André were
      conducted as far as it was necessary to use the intermediate assistance of
      persons within the American lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time a detachment of cavalry, commanded by Colonel Sheldon, was
      stationed at the outposts on the west side of Hudson's River. Colonel
      Sheldon's quarters, with a part of the detachment, were at Salem.
      Lieutenant Colonel Jameson and Major Tallmage, with the remainder, were at
      North Castle. Notice had been given to Sheldon by Arnold, that he expected
      a person from New York, whom he designed to meet at Sheldon's quarters,
      with the prospect of opening through the agency of that person an
      important channel for procuring intelligence. Should such a person arrive,
      he requested Sheldon to show him proper civilities, and send information
      of the same to head-quarters at Robinson's House.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter was then immediately despatched to André, acquainting him with
      this arrangement, and telling him that if he could contrive to make his
      way to the American outposts above White Plains, he would meet with no
      obstacles afterwards, and would be secure under the protection of Colonel
      Sheldon, who was prepared to receive him. Whether André was deterred by
      the hazard of the undertaking, or any other cause, is not known, but he
      did not choose to pursue this course. He wrote a letter to Colonel
      Sheldon, however, dated at New York on the 7th of September, in which he
      said; "I am told my name is made known to you, and that I may hope your
      indulgence in permitting me to meet a friend near your outposts. I will
      endeavor to obtain permission to go out with a flag, which will be sent to
      Dobbs's Ferry on Monday next, the 11th instant, at twelve o'clock, where I
      shall be happy to meet Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Should I not be
      allowed to go, the officer who is to command the escort, between whom and
      myself no distinction need be made, can speak on the affair. Let me
      entreat you, Sir, to favor a matter so interesting to the parties
      concerned, and which is of so private a nature, that the public on neither
      side can be injured by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter was signed <i>John Anderson</i>, and was in some sort an
      enigma to Sheldon, who had not heard the name of the person expected from
      New York. Supposing it probable, however, that the letter came from the
      same person, he enclosed it to Arnold, telling him that his own health was
      such as not to allow him to ride to Dobbs's Ferry by the time appointed,
      and expressing a hope that Arnold would either go himself or employ some
      other trusty messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold replied to Sheldon in a very plausible way, but seemed a little
      embarrassed in clearing up the mystical parts of the letter, especially
      the passage about an escort, which appeared not to tally with the idea of
      a person coming out on such a mission as that, which was pretended to be
      the object of Anderson's visit. He said to Sheldon, that he had been
      obliged to write with great caution, and had signed his letter <i>Gustavus</i>,
      to prevent any discovery in case it should fall into the enemy's hands;
      that since there were several things in Anderson's letter, which appeared
      mysterious, and as Sheldon was unwell, and he had himself business at
      Verplanck's Point, he would proceed to Dobbs's Ferry and meet the flag. He
      added, that, if any occurrence should, prevent the expected meeting at
      Dobbs's Ferry, and Anderson should still come within the outposts, he
      wished Sheldon to send him word by an express, and also to permit Anderson
      to follow with an escort of two or three horsemen, giving as a reason that
      it was difficult for him to ride so far as Sheldon's quarters. As a
      farther cover, he requested Colonel Sheldon himself to accompany Anderson,
      if his health would permit; and even desired that his letters might be
      shown to General Parsons, who was expected daily to come from Connecticut,
      and take command of a body of troops in the neighborhood of Sheldon's
      station. All these particulars were artfully contrived to blind the eyes
      of such persons, as might become acquainted with the business, and to give
      it the air of a transaction for public objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      André's letter to Sheldon, when divested of its disguise, will be seen to
      have had no other object, than to communicate the intelligence, that he
      should be at Dobbs's Ferry at a certain time. He presumed the letter would
      be sent to Arnold, who would understand its meaning, and conduct his plans
      accordingly. So it turned out. Arnold left home in the afternoon of the
      10th, went down the river in his barge to King's Ferry, and passed the
      night at the house of Joshua H. Smith, who resided about two miles and a
      half from the Ferry near the road leading to Haver-straw. Early the next
      morning he proceeded to Dobbs's Ferry, at which place André had arrived
      according to his appointment, accompanied by Colonel Beverly Robinson, to
      whom the secret had already been entrusted by Sir Henry Clinton, probably
      at the suggestion or at least with the knowledge of Arnold. An accident
      occurred, which prevented the interview, and was near putting an end to
      the plot itself. When Arnold was approaching the point of destination by
      water, he was fired upon by the British gunboats stationed in that part of
      the river, and so closely pursued that his life was in danger and he was
      on the point of being taken prisoner. By some oversight the boats had not
      been withdrawn, or it may have been expected that Arnold would come with a
      flag, which appears not to have been the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having landed on the west side of the river, he went down to the Ferry,
      where he remained till night. Whether André and Robinson were at the
      landing-place on the opposite side, or whether they came up from New York
      in a vessel and remained on board, has not been ascertained; but at any
      rate no meeting took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not forgetting his accustomed caution, Arnold wrote a letter to General
      Washington while at Dobbs's Ferry. His passage down the river had been in
      so public a manner, that it could not fail to be known; and he feared
      suspicions might be raised concerning his motives and objects. Filling up
      the principal part of his letter with matters of some importance
      appertaining to his command, he said, as if incidentally, that he had come
      down to that place in order to establish signals, which were to be
      observed in case the enemy ascended the river, and also to give additional
      directions respecting the guard-boats, and to have a beacon fixed on a
      hill about five miles below King's Ferry, which would be necessary to
      alarm the country. These reasons were plausible, and afforded apparent
      proofs of his vigilance, rather than grounds for suspecting any sinister
      designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being foiled in this attempt to mature his scheme of treachery, he left
      Dobbs's Ferry a little after sunset, went up the river in the night, and
      reached his quarters at Robinson's House before morning. André and Colonel
      Robinson returned to New York. Another appointment for an interview was
      now to be made, and the time and place to be fixed upon by the two
      parties; and in this a double circumspection was necessary, since it was
      known to Arnold that within a few days General Washington would cross the
      river at King's Ferry on his way to meet Count de Rochambeau at Hartford.
      It was essential, therefore, so to manage the business, that no suspicious
      intercourse should be carried on at that time between the lines, which
      should attract his notice or come to his knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guarding himself on this point, Arnold found an opportunity of writing to
      André two days after he returned from Dobbs's Ferry, clothing his meaning
      in his usual ambiguous style of a mercantile correspondence. The first
      object of this communication was to caution André not to reveal any thing
      to Colonel Sheldon or any other person, intimating that André's former
      letter to that officer had been a little too free. "I have no confidant,"
      said he; "I have made one too many already, who has prevented some
      profitable speculations." He then said, that a person, in whom confidence
      might be placed, would be at the landing on the east side of Dobbs's
      Ferry, on Wednesday evening the 20th instant; and, if André would be
      there, this person would conduct him to a place of safety, where Arnold
      promised to meet him. He added, "It will be necessary for you to be in
      disguise. I cannot be more explicit at present. Meet me if possible. You
      may rest assured, that, if there is no danger in passing your lines, you
      will be perfectly safe where I propose a meeting." As it was possible that
      André might pursue the original plan of coming into the lines, Arnold
      provided for this contingency by writing to Major Tallmage, who was at one
      of the extreme outposts at North Castle, and instructing him, if a person
      by the name of John Anderson arrived at his station, to send him without
      delay to head-quarters escorted by two dragoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being anxious to press the matter forward with all possible despatch, Sir
      Henry Clinton had sent Colonel Robinson up the river on board the Vulture
      sloop-of-war, before the above letter to André reached New York, with
      orders to proceed as high as Teller's Point, and thus afford the means of
      a more easy intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When arrived there, the first thing requisite was to acquaint Arnold with
      the fact of his being on board. This was done in the following manner. He
      wrote a letter to General Putnam, pretending a belief that he was then in
      the Highlands, and expressing a wish to have a conference with him on an
      affair of private business. This letter he enclosed in another to General
      Arnold, requesting him to hand it to General Putnam, or, if Putnam had
      gone away, to return it to him; and subjoining, that in such case he was
      persuaded General Arnold, "from the humane and generous character he
      bore," would grant him the same favor that he asked of General Putnam.
      These letters were sent by a flag to the officer commanding at Verplanck's
      Point, the Vulture being then in sight of that post and only six or seven
      miles below. So much care and art were used in wording the letters, that,
      had they by any accident fallen into other hands, no one could have
      imagined them to contain a hidden meaning, or to be intended to promote an
      improper purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large amount of Colonel Beverly Robinson's property, in consequence of
      his adhering to the royal cause, had been confiscated by the State of New
      York. The house in which Arnold resided and had his head-quarters, and
      also an extensive tract of land in the neighborhood, belonged to Robinson.
      It was natural, therefore, that he should take measures to retain or
      recover this property, and a correspondence on the subject could not in
      itself be looked upon as extraordinary or suspicious. This was probably
      the reason why Arnold selected him to be a partner in the management of
      his plot, especially since it was necessary that some third person should
      act in an intermediate capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      An occurrence, unforeseen by Colonel Robinson at the time of his writing,
      interposed new embarrassments. It happened that General Washington
      commenced his journey to Hartford on that very day, and crossed the Hudson
      at King's Ferry but a few hours after the flag-boat from the Vulture had
      brought the letters to Verplanck's Point. Arnold came down the river in
      his barge the same afternoon to meet General Washington at that place, as
      a mark of respect to the Commander-in-chief, and doubtless as a
      precautionary step on his own part. He had received Robinson's letter just
      before he left home. Several persons were then with him, and he mentioned
      to Colonel Lamb the nature of its contents, and the name of the person
      from whom it came. Lamb seemed a little surprised that Beverly Robinson
      should open a correspondence of that sort, and told Arnold that the civil
      authority was alone competent to act on such a subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington and the officers of his suite crossed the river in Arnold's
      barge. The Vulture was in full view, and while Washington was looking at
      it through his glass, and speaking in a low tone of voice to the persons
      near him, it was recollected afterwards that Arnold manifested uneasiness
      and emotion. Another incident made a still stronger impression. There was
      a daily expectation of the appearance of a French squadron on the coast
      under Count de Guichen, whose arrival was anxiously desired. The
      conversation turned upon that topic, and Lafayette said in a tone of
      pleasantry, "General Arnold, since you have a correspondence with the
      enemy, you must ascertain as soon as possible what has become of Guichen."
      This was in allusion to the freedom of intercourse between New York and
      West Point, by means of the water communication, and the frequent exchange
      of newspapers, which was kept up through that channel during the war.
      Arnold seemed confused, and hastily demanded what he meant, but
      immediately controlled himself, and the boat came to the shore. At a
      future day these things were brought to the minds of the officers; and it
      was evident to them, that for the moment Arnold thought his plot was
      detected, and that this occasion had been chosen for seizing and securing
      his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happened on Monday, the 18th of September. Arnold accompanied
      Washington to Peekskill, where the whole party passed the night. Early the
      next morning Washington and his retinue pursued their route to Hartford,
      and Arnold returned to West Point. In the mean time, however, he had shown
      to General Washington the letter received the day before from Colonel
      Robinson, and asked his advice as to its contents. This step he was
      prompted to take, in consequence of General Washington's having been
      informed, that a flag had come up from the Vulture with a letter addressed
      to him. It would, moreover, give an air of frankness to his conduct, and
      tend to remove any lurking distrust to which circumstances might have
      administered encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all appearance the letter related only to Robinson's private affair,
      and merely contained a request for an interview respecting that matter.
      Washington did not approve the proposal, and told Arnold that such a
      conference would afford grounds for suspicion in the minds of some people,
      and advised him to avoid it; saying further, that the subject in which
      Colonel Robinson was interested did not come within the powers of a
      military officer, and that the civil government of the State was the only
      authority to which he could properly apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this decision it would have been too hazardous to prosecute
      Robinson's project for a meeting; and being now able to make use of
      Washington's name, Arnold wrote an answer to Robinson's letter, which he
      despatched openly by an officer in a flag-boat to the Vulture. This answer
      consisted of two letters separately sealed, one enclosed within the other,
      and both directed to Colonel Robinson. The outer envelope stated in
      general terms, that he had consulted the Commander-in-chief, who
      disapproved the proposition, and said it was a business wholly belonging
      to the civil authority. The enclosed letter was more explicit, giving
      notice that he should in the night of the 20th instant send a person to
      Dobbs's Ferry, or <i>on board the Vulture</i>, who would be furnished with
      a boat and a flag of truce, and whose secrecy and honor might be depended
      upon. He likewise advised, that the Vulture should remain where she then
      was, till the time appointed. In a postscript he added; "I expect General
      Washington to lodge here on Saturday night next, and I will lay before him
      any matter you may wish to communicate." This hint had the double aim of
      giving the letter an appearance of being written on public business, and
      of making known the time when General Washington would return from
      Hartford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within this second letter was enclosed a copy of the one heretofore
      mentioned as having been sent to André, appointing a place and time of
      meeting at Dobbs's Ferry. The three letters were immediately forwarded to
      Sir Henry Clinton, who received them the same night. With his consent
      André accordingly set off the next morning, that is, on the 20th of
      September, and went to Dobbs's Ferry. It was his first intention to write
      to Captain Sutherland, the commander of the Vulture, and request him to
      drop down the river with the vessel to that place, but, it being late when
      he arrived at the Ferry, he resolved to push forward to the Vulture: and
      to this he was the more inclined, as Arnold in his letter to Robinson had
      said, that he should either send a person to Dobbs's Ferry, or on board
      the Vulture. André reached the vessel at seven o'clock the same evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he left New York, he was positively instructed by Sir Henry Clinton
      not to change his dress, as proposed by General Arnold, nor to go within
      the American posts, nor on any account to take papers. It was his
      expectation, indeed, that Arnold would himself come off to the Vulture,
      notwithstanding his intimation about sending a third person, and that the
      business between them would be there transacted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears, however, that Arnold had contrived a different scheme, which
      could not be explained in his disguised correspondence without running too
      great a risk, and which perhaps he did not care to explain. His particular
      reasons can only be conjectured. Probably he had no other end in view than
      his own safety. However this may be, it was his design to induce André to
      cross the river, and hold the interview on the western side near the
      American lines, if not within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preparations for executing this scheme had already been ingeniously
      contrived. General Howe, the immediate predecessor of Arnold as commandant
      at West Point, had been in the habit of employing Joshua H. Smith to
      procure intelligence from New York. Mr. Smith's respectable standing in
      society, the zeal he had shown in the American cause, his extensive
      acquaintance with people in different ranks of life, and the place of his
      residence on the confines of the American posts, all conspired to render
      his services important. He could select agents, and embrace opportunities,
      not within the power of any other person. General Howe had recommended him
      as a gentleman in whom confidence might be placed, and whose aid would be
      valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      These hints were enough for Arnold, and his quick perception of character
      enabled him to discover in Smith an instrument well suited to his purpose.
      He began by flattering him with particular civilities, asking him to
      head-quarters, visiting him often at his own house, and consulting him on
      subjects of some moment. He continued, as General Howe had done, to
      solicit his agency in keeping up a chain of intelligence and watching the
      movements of the enemy on the river, and furnished him with a written
      permission to pass the guards at all times. Arnold at length told Smith,
      that he expected a man from New York, who would be the bearer of very
      important intelligence, and with whom it was essential for him to have a
      personal conference, but for obvious reasons the affair must be kept a
      profound secret; intimating at the same time, that he might want Smith's
      assistance in conducting the man within the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were in this train, when Mrs. Arnold with her infant child came
      from Philadelphia to join her husband at West Point. On account of the
      heat of the weather, and the fatigue of the journey, she travelled by
      short stages each day, in her own carriage, and it was previously agreed
      that she should pass the last night at the house of Mr. Smith. Here Arnold
      met her, and she went up the river with him in his barge to head-quarters
      only two days before General Washington commenced his tour to Hartford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold having resolved, that André should be brought on shore from the
      Vulture, it became necessary to provide a place for concealing him, in
      case the length of time required to finish the business in hand, or any
      accident, should prevent his prompt and safe return. While on this visit
      he persuaded Smith to permit the rendezvous to be held at his house. To
      prepare the way, all the persons residing in the house except the
      domestics, were to be removed. Under pretence of paying a visit to his
      connexions in Fishkill, more than thirty miles distant, Smith went with
      his wife and family the next day to that town. Leaving his family at
      Fishkill he immediately returned, and, as Robinson's house was near the
      road, he called on General Arnold according to his previous request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it was arranged, that Smith should go on board the Vulture, or down
      to Dobbs's Ferry, in the night of the next day, and bring on shore the
      person, who was expected to be there. Orders had been given to Major
      Kierse, the quartermaster at Stony Point, to supply Smith with a boat
      whenever he should want one, and Arnold took care to give him the
      customary pass for a flag of truce, and such letters as would be
      understood on board the Vulture. With these papers Smith went back to his
      own house the same evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason, which cannot now be explained, he did not go on board the
      next night, as was at first intended. It is probable, that he was
      disappointed in his attempt to procure a boat, and also to find boatmen
      who were willing to accompany him. Samuel Colquhoun, one of his tenants,
      to whom he applied for the purpose in the course of the day, refused to go
      with him, alleging a fear of being taken up by the guard-boats. Thus
      defeated in his object, he hastened to inform General Arnold as soon as
      possible, and sent Colquhoun as an express, who rode all night and got to
      Robinson's House just before sunrise. The General was not up, but the
      messenger sent in the letter he had brought from Smith, and was told that
      no answer was required, and he might go back as quick as he could. In the
      early part of the day Arnold himself went down the river to Verplanck's
      Point, and thence to Smith's House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now return to the Vulture. André had remained on board all night
      anxiously expecting to meet General Arnold there, according to the tenor
      of his letter. He was greatly disappointed that no person appeared, and he
      wrote the next morning to Sir Henry Clinton in somewhat of a desponding
      tone, saying that this was the second excursion he had made without any
      ostensible reason, and a third would infallibly fix suspicions. He thought
      it best, therefore, to stay where he was for a short time at least, under
      pretence of sickness, and try further expedients. It was also in his
      opinion possible, that Arnold, uninformed of his having come up to the
      vessel, might have sought to meet him at Dobbs's Ferry as first proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      An opportunity presented itself by which he was enabled to communicate the
      knowledge of his being on board. During the day of his arrival a flag of
      truce had been exhibited at Teller's Point, inviting, as it was supposed,
      a pacific intercourse for some object with the ship. The captain sent off
      a boat with another flag, but as soon as it approached the shore it was
      fired upon by several armed men hitherto concealed. This treacherous
      violation of the laws of war was deemed a proper subject for a
      remonstrance, and a sufficient reason for an open transmission of a flag
      with a letter to the American commanding officer. Such a despatch was
      indited and signed by Captain Sutherland, but it was in the handwriting of
      André, and countersigned John Anderson as secretary. The letter was dated
      on the morning of the 21st of September.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of Smith's express the night before, Arnold arrived at
      Verplanck's Point just as the flag-boat had returned to the Vulture, and
      he received the letter from Colonel Livingston, the officer commanding at
      that post. Knowing the handwriting, he understood its design, and hastened
      to prepare for sending Smith on board the ensuing night. Crossing over to
      Stony Point and finding no boat in readiness, he despatched an officer in
      his own barge to the Continental Village, which stood near a creek that
      emptied itself into the Hudson above Stony Point, with orders to bring
      down a row-boat from that place. Then directing Major Kierse, the
      quartermaster at Stony Point, to send the boat to a certain place in
      Haverstraw Creek the moment it should arrive, he proceeded to Smith's
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair was now reduced within a definite compass. André was to be
      brought on shore from the Vulture. All the preparations had been made,
      Smith was ready, and nothing was wanting but two boatmen, who would
      voluntarily engage in the enterprise. To remove all obstacles on this
      score, Smith had previously agreed upon a countersign with the commanders
      of the guard-boats, who had been ordered by Colonel Livingston not to stop
      him, should he pass them in the night, as he was employed by the General
      to obtain intelligence of an important nature within the enemy's lines.
      These guard-boats were stationed in the river, whenever a British vessel
      of war came up, for the double purpose of preventing an intercourse with
      the shore, and obstructing the conveyance of supplies by the Tories and
      disaffected persons. The countersign or watchword, adopted on the present
      occasion, was <i>Congress</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening, Smith called Samuel Colquhoun, and told him that General
      Arnold wished to speak with him. Colquhoun went into the house, where he
      found Arnold, who requested him to accompany Mr. Smith in a boat to the
      Vulture. He at once declined, and gave as a reason, that having been
      deprived of his rest all the preceding night by riding express, he was
      fatigued, and could not endure the labor and want of sleep. He hinted
      likewise his fears of being out in the night on such a mission, and the
      danger to which he would be exposed if taken up by the guard-boats; and
      said he should always be willing to render any service to the General when
      he could do it with propriety, intimating that he should not object to go
      in the morning with a flag by daylight. Arnold replied, that the morning
      would be too late; that there was a gentleman on board the vessel whom he
      must see in the night, and who must be brought on shore; that it was a
      business of the utmost importance to the country, and that if he was a
      friend to his country he would not hesitate a moment in complying with the
      request. Smith joined in the same strain, and asked the man if he would
      not do what the General desired for the public good, and if he did not
      think it his duty, especially as he was himself to go with him and run an
      equal risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colquhoun wavered a little at these representations, but still he was
      reluctant, and started new objections, and could not understand why it was
      necessary to go in the dark on such an errand, which he knew to be
      irregular and hazardous. Arnold assured him, that the matter was not a
      secret, but well known to the officers; that Major Kierse had provided a
      boat; that the commanders of the guard-boats were acquainted with the
      business, knew the countersign, and would let the boat pass without
      molestation; and that it was necessary to go in the night and bring the
      man on shore secretly, in order to prevent the transaction from becoming
      generally divulged to the inhabitants, thus making a noise and spreading;
      rumors, which would obstruct if not defeat the great object he had in view
      for the public benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Colquhoun said, apparently to get rid of further importunity, that
      he could not manage the boat alone. Smith told him to call his brother,
      Joseph Colquhoun, which he did; but while absent he and his brother
      agreed, that they would not go. When they returned, Joseph Colquhoun was
      first met by Smith, who used the same arguments that had been applied to
      his brother, but with little apparent success. Arnold tried anew the force
      of persuasion and of appeals to their patriotism. It was all in vain. The
      brothers seemed resolute and immovable. Arnold then resorted to another
      mode of carrying his point, which proved more effectual. He declared to
      them, that if they persisted in their obstinacy, and refused to give their
      assistance when required for the good of the country, he should look upon
      them as disaffected to the common cause, and put them under arrest. It was
      no wonder, that a menace of this sort, from a person so high in rank,
      should quiet the scruples or at least secure the acquiescence of these
      simple laborers. They consented to comply with his request, or rather to
      obey his orders. As an encouragement, and a reward for their services, he
      promised to give each of them fifty pounds of flour; but the promise was
      never fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past eleven o'clock in the night when Smith and the two boatmen
      arrived at the landing, near the mouth of Haverstraw Creek, to which place
      Major Kierse had sent the boat. They muffled the oars by General Arnold's
      directions. The night was tranquil and serene, the stars shone brightly,
      the water was unruffled except by the gentle current, which was hardly
      perceptible in that wide part of the river, and the boat glided along
      silently, without being discovered or meeting with any hindrance, till
      they were hailed by a hoarse seaman's voice from the Vulture, inquiring
      who they were and whither bound. Smith answered, that they were from
      King's Ferry and on their way to Dobbs's Ferry. The boat was immediately
      ordered alongside, and a torrent of uncourtly epithets, peculiar to the
      sailor's vocabulary, was poured out upon them for presuming to approach
      one of his Majesty's ships under the cover of darkness. While the officer
      of the watch was uttering this nautical salutation, Smith clambered up the
      ship's side. It is to be understood, of course, that no person in the
      vessel had any knowledge of the matter in hand except Captain Sutherland,
      Robinson, and André. The noise was heard below, and a boy came on deck
      with orders from the captain, that the man should be shown into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Smith entered the captain's apartment, he there found Beverly
      Robinson, whom he knew, having previously been acquainted with him. A
      letter from Arnold was then presented to Robinson, in which Arnold said;
      "This will be delivered to you by Mr. Smith, who will conduct you to a
      place of safety. Neither Mr. Smith nor any other person shall be made
      acquainted with your proposals. If they (which I doubt not) are of such a
      nature, that I can officially take notice of them, I shall do it with
      pleasure. I take it for granted Colonel Robinson will not propose any
      thing, that is not for the interest of the United States as well as of
      himself." It was the object of this letter to guard against accidents, in
      case any occurrence should prevent Smith's getting on board, and his
      papers should be examined. It might also be intended as a blind to Smith
      himself, who supposed Beverly Robinson to be the person he was to bring on
      shore, as he informs us in his narrative; although it is manifest from one
      of Smith's passports, that he at least supposed Beverly Robinson might
      possibly depute a person by the name of John Anderson to take his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith had two papers signed by Arnold; one authorizing him "to go to
      Dobbs's Ferry, with three men and a boy in a boat with a flag, to carry
      some letters of a private nature for a gentleman in New York, and to
      return immediately, he having permission to go at such hours and times as
      the tide and his business suit;" the other, granting "permission to Joshua
      Smith, Mr. John Anderson, and two servants, to pass and repass the guards
      near King's Ferry at all times."
    </p>
    <p>
      These papers were shown to Robinson, by whom they were understood; or
      rather they had no other meaning, than to communicate the idea, that the
      writer expected André to come on shore (and not Robinson as he had held
      out to Smith), and to secure the boat against being detained by the
      water-guards, should it happen that by any mistake they had not been
      furnished with the private countersign.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Smith had sat a few minutes in the cabin, Robinson left him in
      conversation with Captain Sutherland, and in about a quarter of an hour
      returned with another person, whom he introduced as Mr. Anderson.
      Assigning ill health as a reason why he could not himself go on shore, he
      said this gentleman would go in his stead, who, being perfectly acquainted
      with the business upon which the consultation was to be held, would be
      able to give all the information and make all the arrangements desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Arnold was expected on board in person, it was doubtless a subject of
      deliberation whether any one should leave the ship and run the hazard of
      going on shore, with no other pledge of protection, than the word of a
      man, who was seeking to betray his country. It has been said, that
      Robinson was decidedly opposed to such a step, but was overruled by André,
      whose eagerness to accomplish the enterprise he had undertaken made him
      regardless of danger. Although clothed in his uniform, he was so
      completely enveloped with a blue great-coat, that no part of his dress
      could be seen; and Smith always affirmed, that he had no surmise of his
      real name or character, but looked upon him as a private individual acting
      an intermediate part between Robinson and Arnold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat in which Smith came down the river was large, and being rowed by
      two men only, the Captain of the Vulture proposed that one of his boats
      should go out armed and tow the other; but this was strongly objected to
      by Smith and André. It was easy to discover, that the less noise the more
      safety. The reason assigned by Sir Henry Clinton in his despatch, for
      their declining this aid was, that it would be inconsistent with a flag of
      truce. As there was no pretence of a flag of truce, except in the
      formality of Arnold's passport, this reason was supposititious.
    </p>
    <p>
      André and Smith descended into the boat together. The watermen had not
      left it. Few words were spoken as they moved slowly towards the shore.
      They landed at the foot of a mountain, called the Long Clove, on the
      western margin of the river, about six miles below Stony Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this place Arnold had ridden on horseback from Smith's House, attended
      by one of Smith's servants on another horse. The exact spot for the
      rendezvous had been agreed upon, and, as soon as the boat landed, Smith
      went up the bank, groping his way in darkness, and found Arnold not only
      shrouded in the shades of night, but concealed among thick bushes and
      trees. He then returned and conducted André to the same place. At Arnold's
      request he left them together, and joined the men again at the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overcome with fatigue, and unconscious of any heavier burden upon their
      spirits, the watermen found relief from their toils in sleep. Smith was
      wakeful and little at ease. Mortified and displeased, as he says, at not
      being permitted to be present at the interview, after all the pains he had
      taken and sacrifices he had made to bring it about, he was not in a humor
      to draw solace from tranquillity and meditation; and the damps of an
      autumnal night, piercing a frame that had been for some time shivering
      under the discipline of a tertian ague, were not likely to communicate
      soothing influences. No wonder that the hours seemed to move on leaden
      wings, and his stock of patience was soon exhausted. He went into the
      bushes and reminded the plotters of treason, that the night was far spent,
      and the boat must depart from its present station before daylight should
      appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roused by this intimation, and not yet having entirely effected the object
      of their meeting, the conspirators consented, that he and the boatmen
      should return up the river. Meantime André mounted the servant's horse,
      and accompanied Arnold to Smith's House, being a distance of three or four
      miles along the road leading through the village of Haverstraw. It was
      dark, and the voice of the sentinel demanding the countersign was the
      first indication to André, that he was within the American lines. This
      circumstance was unexpected, and he now felt the real danger of his
      situation. It was too late to change his purpose, and he could only nerve
      himself with fortitude to meet whatever peril might await him. Just as the
      day dawned, they came to Smith's House; and in a little time Smith
      arrived, having brought the boat to Crom Island in Haverstraw Creek, where
      it was left. The boatmen retired to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the question be asked, why André did not return on board from the
      Long Clove, in the same way he came on shore, the true answer undoubtedly
      is, that his business with Arnold was not finished, and could not be
      brought to a close soon enough to allow the boat to go and come again
      during the night. Since Arnold himself went down to meet André at the
      Clove, it may be inferred, that he thought everything might possibly be
      completed there; otherwise he would have been more likely to wait for him
      at Smith's House, and have him conducted thither through the safest and
      most expeditious channel, which would have been by water up Haverstraw
      Creek to the place where the boat was ultimately left, which was but a
      short distance from the house. It is equally certain, however, that he had
      anticipated a want of time for doing at the landing-place all that was
      requisite; as he had provided for such a contingency, first, by having
      Smith's family removed, secondly, by taking a spare horse with him to the
      Clove. Smith had said, while on board the Vulture, that a horse would be
      ready on the bank of the river for the purpose of conducting the person to
      his house, who should go with him in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his narrative Smith states, that Arnold pressed him and the boatmen
      very hard to return to the Vulture that night, but they all refused on
      account of the lateness of the hour. This statement does not agree with
      the testimony of the watermen at Smith's trial; from which it appears,
      that they did not see Arnold at the landing-place; they only heard a man
      in the bushes. One of them testified, that Smith said nothing to him about
      returning, and the other, that he asked him, soon after they landed, if he
      would assist to row the boat back to the ship, but he declined, and Smith
      did not urge it. In short, the proof is sufficiently clear, that more time
      was necessary for maturing the plans in agitation, and that this was the
      reason why no attempt was made to send André back to the Vulture before
      morning.

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Outlines of the Plan for surrendering West Point.&mdash;Major André
      passes in Disguise through the American Posts.&mdash;His Capture at
      Tarrytown.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>o sooner had the
      parties arrived at Smith's House, than a cannonade was heard down the
      river. It was discovered to be against the Vulture, which, although
      distant several miles, was in full view, and for a time seemed to be on
      fire. It had been reported to Colonel Livingston by messengers from
      Teller's Point, that the vessel was so near the shore as to be within
      reach of cannon-shot, and that the inhabitants were likewise apprehensive
      boats would land and commit depredations. Colonel Livingston accordingly
      sent from Verplanck's Point a party with cannon, who fired upon the
      Vulture and compelled her to remove from the position she had held during
      the night, and drop farther down the river, till she was beyond the reach
      of the shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      André beheld this scene from the windows of Smith's House with anxious
      emotion. At length the firing ceased, and he resumed his wonted spirits
      and composure. He was in an upper apartment of the house, where he
      remained through the day. After breakfast Smith left André and Arnold
      together, and here the plot of treachery was finished, the conditions
      settled, and the modes of future action explained and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      As all this was done in secret, the details have never been fully brought
      to light. It is well ascertained, however, that, in case of success,
      Arnold was to be paid a very large amount of money. In his letter to the
      ministry on the subject, Sir Henry Clinton said he thought the plan of
      such vast importance, that it ought to be pursued "at every risk and <i>at
      any expense.</i>" Arnold well knew the nature of the posts, which he was
      about to surrender, and, money being with him the stimulating motive in
      the transaction, it may be presumed his demands were in proportion to the
      advantages expected from his guilt. Nor is it probable, that he consented
      without a price to barter the brilliant reputation he then possessed for a
      name of ever-enduring infamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangements being agreed upon for the execution of the plot, it is
      understood that the day was also fixed. André was to return to New York,
      and the British troops, already embarked under the pretext of an
      expedition to the Chesapeake, were to be ready to ascend the river at a
      moment's warning. The post at West Point was to be weakened by such a
      disposition of the troops, as would leave but a small force for its
      defence. As soon as it should be known, that the British were coming up
      the river, parties were to be sent out from the garrison to the gorges in
      the hills, and other distant points, under pretence of meeting the enemy
      as they approached; and here they were to remain, while the British troops
      landed and marched to the garrison through different routes in which they
      would meet no opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an accurate plan of West Point and its environs, these details were
      easily settled. The general principle, which served as a basis of the
      whole manouvre, was, that the troops should be so scattered, and divided
      into such small detachments, that they could not act in force, and would
      be obliged to surrender without any effectual resistance. By previous
      movements Arnold had in fact prepared the way for this scheme. Sir Henry
      Clinton, and many other British officers, were acquainted with the
      localities at West Point and in its neighborhood, they having been there
      for several days after the storming of Fort Montgomery. Hence it was not
      difficult to concert a plan of operations, which should be equally
      intelligible to both parties, and hold out the fairest prospect of a
      successful result.
    </p>
    <p>
      These preliminaries being finished, and André supplied with certain papers
      explanatory of the military condition of West Point, the next topic for
      deliberation was how he should get back to New York. André insisted that
      he should be put on board the Vulture, to which Arnold assented, but at
      the same time mentioned obstacles, and suggested a return by land as more
      safe and expeditious. The precise nature of these obstacles is not known,
      but they probably arose from Smith's disinclination to go out again with
      the boat, and the impossibility at that time of finding any other person
      as his substitute. When Arnold went away, however, which was before ten
      o'clock, André supposed he was to be sent on board the Vulture, as will
      appear by the following extract from a paper which he wrote after his
      capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arnold quitted me," said he, "having himself made me put the papers I
      bore between my stockings and feet. Whilst he did it he expressed a wish,
      in case of any accident befalling me, that they should be destroyed; which
      I said of course would be the case, as when I went into the boat I should
      have them tied about with a string and a stone. Before we parted, some
      mention had been made of my crossing the river and going another route;
      but I objected much against it, and thought it was settled, that in the
      way I came I was to return."
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold left him and went up the river in his own barge to head-quarters.
      Before he departed from Smith's House, he urged Smith to go back with
      André to the Vulture as soon as it should be dark; yet the matter seems to
      have been undecided, for he wrote and gave to Smith two passports (dating
      them "Head-Quarters"), one authorizing him to go by water, and the other
      by land. The former was in these words. "Joshua Smith has permission to
      pass with a boat and three hands and a flag to Dobbs's Ferry, on public
      business, and to return immediately." The latter said, "Joshua Smith has
      permission to pass the guards to the White Plains and to return, he being
      on public business by my direction." To this was added a third, as
      follows. "Permit Mr. John Anderson to pass the guards to the White Plains,
      or below if he chooses, he being on public business by my direction." This
      last was the paper presented by André to his captors when he was taken.
      All these passports were in the handwriting of Arnold and signed by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      André passed the day in solitude, and as it drew near to a close, he was
      impatient to be ready for his departure. On consulting Smith, he found him
      obstinately determined not to return to the Vulture, and that he had
      neither spoken to the watermen nor made any other preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason he gave afterwards for this refusal was, that his ague had
      attacked him severely, and the state of his health would not admit of an
      exposure in the boat. But the fact of his agreeing to accompany André on
      horseback, and to travel with him several hours in the night, was a proof
      that this was not the true ground of his objection. It was absurd to talk
      of being too ill to sit in a boat, and the next moment to mount a horse
      and ride a dozen miles. Smith's motives cannot now be ascertained, he
      never having explained them himself, either in the course of his trial, or
      in his Narrative; but he was probably alarmed at the firing upon the
      Vulture in the morning, and, as the vessel had resumed her original
      station, he was fearful it might be repeated, and thus endanger his
      personal safety, should he attempt to go on board. This is the only
      plausible way in which we can account for his resisting the strong
      solicitations of both Arnold and André, when he was sure of having the
      same protection as the night before. There is, after all, something
      mysterious in the affair; for, if this was the true and only cause of his
      reluctance, it was one, which might very properly have been urged, and
      would at least have relieved him from the subterfuge of the ague, which
      was too shallow to gain credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any inquiry on this head would be fruitless. Indeed it is of little
      importance. It is enough to know, that, having no means of getting to the
      vessel, André was compelled to seek his way back by land. The safest route
      was supposed to be across the river and in the direction of White Plains.
      Smith agreed to attend him on the way, till he should be out of danger
      from the American posts. Thus far Arnold's passports would protect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his entreaties being without avail, and having no other resort, André
      submitted to the necessity of his situation, and resolved to pursue the
      route by land. Arnold had prevailed upon him, in case he took this course,
      to exchange his military coat for a citizen's dress. It was feared, that,
      if he was discovered in the uniform of a British officer, he might be
      stopped, and perhaps meet with trouble. And here again Smith was made the
      dupe of Arnold's artifices. When he expressed surprise, that a man in a
      civil capacity, and on an errand of business, should come from New York in
      such a dress, Arnold told him that it was owing to the pride and vanity of
      Anderson, who wished to make a figure as a man of consequence, and had
      borrowed a coat from a military acquaintance. Upon this representation
      Smith gave one of his coats in exchange, which André put on, leaving his
      own behind. Thus clad, and covered as before with his dark greatcoat,
      which had a wide cape buttoned close in the neck, and the appearance of
      having been much worn, André was equipped for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before sunset he and Smith set off, accompanied by a negro
      servant belonging to the latter. They proceeded to King's Ferry, and
      crossed the river from Stony Point to Verplanck's Point. On their way to
      the Ferry, they met several persons who were known to Smith, and with whom
      he conversed, accosting them in a gay and jocular humor, and assuming an
      air of ease and unconcern. He even stopped at a sutler's tent near the
      Ferry, and contributed to the merriment of a party of loungers, by
      assisting them in drinking a bowl of punch. André said nothing, but walked
      his horse slowly along, and was waiting at the Ferry when his companion
      overtook him. Smith had tried, while on the road, to draw him into
      conversation about the taking of Stony Point the year before, and such
      other topics as he thought would interest him; but he was reserved and
      thoughtful, uttering brief replies, and showing no inclination to be
      interrogated, or to talk upon any subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the dusk of the evening when they ascended from the Ferry, and
      passed through the works at Verplanck's Point. Smith rode up to Colonel
      Livingston's tent, at a short distance from the road, but André and the
      servant went along without stopping. Smith told Colonel Livingston, that
      he was going up the country, and took charge of two letters, one to
      General Arnold and the other to Governor Clinton, which he promised to
      deliver. He declined staying to supper, alleging as a reason that a
      gentleman had just rode along, who was waiting for him, and whose business
      was urgent. He then joined André on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met with no further interruption till between eight and nine o'clock
      at night, when they were hailed by the sentinel of a patrolling party.
      This was near Crompond, and about eight miles from Verplanck's Point. The
      sentinel ordered them to stop, and Smith dismounted, gave the bridle of
      his horse to his servant, walked forward, and inquired who commanded the
      party. He was answered "Captain Boyd," who, overhearing the conversation,
      immediately appeared. The captain was unusually inquisitive, and demanded
      of him who he was, where he belonged, and what was his business. Smith
      answered these questions promptly, adding that he had a pass from General
      Arnold, and desired not to be detained. The captain was not yet satisfied,
      but inquired how far he meant to go that night; to which he replied, as
      far as Major Strang's or Colonel Drake's; but this only increased the
      embarrassment, for the captain informed him, that Major Strang was not at
      home, and Colonel Drake had removed to another part of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Boyd then said, that he must see the passport, and, it being dark,
      they went to a house at a small distance to procure a light. André began
      to be a little alarmed, and advanced with reluctance towards the house,
      till he was encouraged by Smith, who assured him that Arnold's pass would
      certainly protect them. And so it proved; for the pass was expressed in
      positive terms, and there was no room to doubt its genuineness or its
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was afterwards more bland in his manners, but the ardor of his
      curiosity was not diminished. He took Smith aside, and begged to be
      informed of the important business, which carried him down so near the
      enemy's lines, and induced him and his companion to travel so dangerous a
      road in the night. As an apology for this inquiry he manifested a good
      deal of concern for their safety, telling him that the Cow-boys had
      recently been out, and were believed then to be far up the country, and he
      advised him by all means not to proceed till morning. Smith prevaricated
      as well as he could, saying to Captain Boyd, that he and his
      fellow-traveller, whom he called <i>Mr. Anderson</i>, were employed by
      General Arnold to procure intelligence, that they expected to meet a
      person near White Plains for that purpose, and that it was necessary for
      them to go forward as expeditiously as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this statement Captain Boyd seemed more anxious than ever, magnified
      the perils to which they would be exposed by travelling in the night, and
      recommended anew that they should turn back to one Andreas Miller's, who
      lived but a little way off, and at whose house they might lodge. Smith's
      courage was somewhat damped by these representations, and he went and told
      the tale to André, and counselled with him, as to the steps they ought to
      take. It is probable, also, that he had fears of exciting suspicion, if he
      persevered in resisting the captain's zeal expressed so earnestly in their
      behalf. André, as it may well be imagined, not being very easy in his
      present situation, was for going on at all events. When Smith found his
      fears unheeded and his eloquence unavailing, he called in the aid of
      Captain Boyd, and inquired of him which was the safest road to White
      Plains. Boyd considered both roads perilous, but believed the one through
      North Castle the least so, for the <i>Lower Party</i>, or Cow-boys,
      infested the Tarrytown road, and had lately done mischief in that quarter.
      He used various arguments to dissuade them from going farther that night,
      to which Smith listened with open ears, and he resolved, against the will
      of André, to trespass on the hospitality of Andreas Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met with a welcome reception, but, coming at a late hour to an humble
      dwelling, their accommodations were narrow, and the two travelers were
      obliged to sleep in the same bed. According to Smith's account, it was a
      weary and restless night to his companion. The burden on his thoughts was
      not of a kind to lull them to repose; and the place of his retreat, so
      near the watchful Captain Boyd and his guards, was hardly such as would
      impress upon him a conviction of perfect security. At the first dawn of
      light he roused himself from his troubled slumbers, waked the servant, and
      ordered the horses to be prepared for an early departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having solicited their host in vain to receive a compensation for the
      civilities he had rendered, they mounted and took the road leading to
      Pine's Bridge. The countenance of André brightened when he was fairly
      beyond the reach of the patrolling party, and, as he thought, had left
      behind him the principal difficulties in his route. His cheerfulness
      revived, and he conversed in the most animated and agreeable strain upon a
      great variety of topics. Smith professes to have been astonished at the
      sudden and extraordinary change which appeared in him, from a gloomy
      taciturnity to an exuberant flow of spirits, pleasantry, and gay
      discourse. He talked upon poetry, the arts, and literature, lamented the
      war, and hoped for a speedy peace. In this manner they passed along,
      without being accosted by any person, till they came within two miles and
      a half of Pine's Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this place Smith had determined to end his journey in the direction
      towards White Plains. The Cow-boys, whom he seemed anxious to avoid, had
      recently been above the Bridge; and the territory below was considered
      their appropriate domain. The travellers partook of a frugal breakfast
      together at the house of a good Dutch woman, who had been plundered by the
      marauders, but who was yet enabled to set before them a repast of
      hasty-pudding and milk. This being despatched, Smith divided his small
      stock of paper money with André, took a final leave, and with his servant
      hastened back to Peekskill, and the same evening to Fishkill, where he had
      left his family four days before at the house of his brother-inlaw. On his
      way he took the road leading by Robinson's House, where he called on
      General Arnold and dined. He gave an account of André's progress, and
      mentioned the place where he left him, with which Arnold appeared well
      pleased. It is to be understood, however, that Smith had not at this time,
      as he always affirmed, any knowledge of André's true character, and that
      he supposed his name to be John Anderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cow-boys were a set of people, mostly if not wholly refugees,
      belonging to the British side, and engaged in plundering cattle near the
      lines and driving them to New York. The name indicates their vocation.
      There was another description of banditti, called <i>Skinners</i>, who
      lived for the most part within the American lines, and professed
      attachment to the American cause; but in reality they were more
      unprincipled, perfidious, and inhuman, than the Cow-boys themselves; for
      these latter exhibited some symptoms of fellow-feeling for their friends,
      whereas the Skinners committed their depredations equally upon friends and
      foes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a law of the State of New York, every person refusing to take an oath
      of fidelity to the State was considered as forfeiting his property. The
      large territory between the American and British lines, extending nearly
      thirty miles from north to south, and embracing Westchester county, was
      populous and highly cultivated. A person living within that space, who
      took the oath of fidelity, was sure to be plundered by the Cowboys; and if
      he did not take it, the Skinners would come down upon him, call him a
      Tory, and seize his property as confiscated by the State. Thus the
      execution of the laws was assumed by robbers, and the innocent and guilty
      were involved in a common ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, the civil authority endeavored to guard against these
      outrages, as far as it could, by legislative enactments and executive
      proclamations; but, from the nature of the case, this formidable
      conspiracy against the rights and claims of humanity could be crushed only
      by a military arm. The detachments of Continental troops and militia,
      stationed near the lines, did something to lessen the evil; yet they were
      not adequate to its suppression, and frequently this force was so feeble
      as not to afford any barrier to the inroads of the banditti. The Skinners
      and Cow-boys often leagued together. The former would sell their plunder
      to the latter, taking in exchange contraband articles brought from New
      York. It was not uncommon for the farce of a skirmish to be acted near the
      American lines, in which the Skinners never failed to come off victorious;
      and then they would go boldly to the interior with their booty, pretending
      it had been captured from the enemy, while attempting to smuggle it across
      the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the social condition of that part of the country, through which
      André was now to pass alone, for nearly thirty miles, before he could be
      perfectly secure from danger; for, although every step diminished the
      chances of untoward accidents, yet there was no absolute safety till he
      was beyond the limits of this ill-famed neutral ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he and Smith separated, it seems to have been understood, that André
      would pursue the route through White Plains, and thence to New York; but
      after crossing Pine's Bridge, he changed his mind, turned off towards
      Hudson's River, and took what was called the Tarrytown road. He was
      probably induced to this step by the remarks he had heard the evening
      before from Captain Boyd, who said the Lower Party had been far up the
      Tarrytown road, and it was dangerous to proceed that way. As the Lower
      Party belonged to the British, and André would of course be safe in their
      hands, it was natural for him to infer, that he should be among friends
      sooner in that direction than in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A law of the State of New York authorized any person to seize and convert
      to his own use all cattle or beef, that should be driven or removed from
      the country in the direction of the city beyond a certain line in
      Westchester county. By military custom, also, the personal effects of
      prisoners, taken by small parties, were assigned to the captors as a
      prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that, the same morning on which André crossed Pine's Bridge,
      seven persons, who resided near Hudson's River, on the neutral ground,
      agreed voluntarily to go out in company armed, watch the road, and
      intercept any suspicious stragglers, or droves of cattle, that might be
      seen passing towards New York. Four of this party were stationed on a
      hill, where they had a view of the road for a considerable distance. The
      three others, named John Paulding, David Williams, and Isaac Van Wart,
      were concealed in the bushes at another place and very near the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half a mile north of the village of Tarrytown, and a few hundred
      yards from the bank of Hudson's River, the road crosses a small brook,
      from each side of which the ground rises into a hill, and it was at that
      time covered over with trees and underbrush. Eight or ten rods south of
      this brook, and on the west side of the road, these men were hidden; and
      at that point André was stopped, after having travelled from Pine's Bridge
      without interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particulars of this event I shall here introduce, as they are narrated
      in the testimony given by Paulding and Williams at Smith's trial, written
      down at the time by the judge-advocate, and preserved in manuscript among
      the other papers. This testimony having been taken only eleven days after
      the capture of André, when every circumstance must have been fresh in the
      recollection of his captors, it may be regarded as exhibiting a greater
      exactness in its details, than any account hitherto published. In answer
      to the question of the court, Paulding said; "Myself, Isaac Van Wart, and
      David Williams were lying by the side of the road about half a mile above
      Tarrytown, and about fifteen miles above Kingsbridge, on Saturday morning,
      between nine and ten o'clock, the 23d of September. We had lain there
      about an hour and a half, as near as I can recollect, and saw several
      persons we were acquainted with, whom we let pass. Presently one of the
      young men, who were with me, said, 'There comes a gentlemanlike-looking
      man, who appears to be well dressed, and has boots on, and whom you had
      better step out and stop, if you don't know him.' On that I got up, and
      presented my firelock at the breast of the person, and told him to stand;
      and then I asked him which way he was going. 'Gentlemen,' said he, 'I hope
      you belong to our party.' I asked him what party. He said, 'The Lower
      Party.' Upon that I told him I did. Then he said, 'I am a British officer
      out of the country on particular business, and I hope you will not detain
      me a minute;' and to show that he was a British officer he pulled out his
      watch. Upon which I told him to dismount. He then said, 'My God, I must do
      any thing to get along,' and seemed to make a kind of laugh of it, and
      pulled out General Arnold's pass, which was to John Anderson, to pass all
      guards to White Plains and below. Upon that he dismounted. Said he,
      'Gentlemen, you had best let me go, or you will bring yourselves into
      trouble, for your stopping me will detain the General's business;' and
      said he was going to Dobbs's Ferry to meet a person there and get
      intelligence for General Arnold. Upon that I told him I hoped he would not
      be offended, that we did not mean to take any thing from him; and I told
      him there were many bad people, who were going along the road, and I did
      not know but perhaps he might be one."
    </p>
    <p>
      When further questioned, Paulding replied, that he asked the person his
      name, who told him it was John Anderson; and that, when Anderson produced
      General Arnold's pass, he should have let him go, if he had not before
      called himself a British officer. Paulding also said, that when the person
      pulled out his watch, he understood it as a signal that he was a British
      officer, and not that he meant to offer it to him as a present.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these particulars were substantially confirmed by David Williams,
      whose testimony in regard to the searching of André, being more minute
      than Paulding's, is here inserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We took him into the bushes," said Williams, "and ordered him to pull off
      his clothes, which he did; but on searching him narrowly we could not find
      any sort of writings. We told him to pull off his boots, which he seemed
      to be indifferent about; but we got one boot off, and searched in that
      boot, and could find nothing. But we found there were some papers in the
      bottom of his stocking next to his foot; on which we made him pull his
      stocking off, and found three papers wrapped up. Mr. Paulding looked at
      the contents, and said he was a spy. We then made him pull off his other
      boot, and there we found three more papers at the bottom of his foot
      within his stocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon this we made him dress himself, and I asked him what he would give
      us to let him go. He said he would give us any sum of money. I asked him
      whether he would give us his horse, saddle, bridle, watch, and one hundred
      guineas. He said 'Yes,' and told us he would direct them to any place,
      even if it was that very spot, so that we could get them. I asked him
      whether he would not give us more. He said he would give us any quantity
      of dry goods, or any sum of money, and bring it to any place that we might
      pitch upon, so that we might get it. Mr. Paulding answered, 'No, if you
      would give us ten thousand guineas, you should not stir one step.' I then
      asked the person, who had called himself John Anderson, if he would not
      get away if it lay in his power. He answered, 'Yes, I would.' I told him I
      did not intend he should. While taking him along we asked him a few
      questions, and we stopped under a shade. He begged us not to ask him
      questions, and said when he came to any commander he would reveal all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was dressed in a blue over-coat, and a tight body-coat, that was of a
      kind of claret color, though a rather deeper red than claret. The
      button-holes were laced with gold tinsel, and the buttons drawn over with
      the same kind of lace. He had on a round hat, and nankeen waistcoat and
      breeches, with a flannel waistcoat and drawers, boots, and thread
      stockings."
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest military post was at North Castle, where Lieutenant Colonel
      Jameson was stationed with a part of Sheldon's regiment of dragoons. To
      that place it was resolved to take the prisoner; and within a few hours he
      was delivered up to Jameson, with all the papers that had been taken from
      his boots.

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>André makes known his true Character.&mdash;His Letter to Washington.&mdash;Escape
      of Arnold to the Enemy.&mdash;Washington arrives at West Point.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he course pursued
      by Jameson was extraordinary and inexplicable. On examining the papers, he
      found them to be in the undisguised handwriting of General Arnold, with
      which he was perfectly acquainted. Their contents and the manner of their
      being found were such, as, one would think, could not fail to excite
      suspicion in the most obtuse mind, whatever might be the rank or character
      of the party concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were six separate papers, as follows. First, artillery orders, which
      had recently been published at West Point, giving directions how each
      corps should dispose of itself in case of an alarm. This paper was of the
      utmost importance, as it would enable the enemy, when they should make an
      attack, to know the precise condition of every part of the garrison.
      Secondly, an estimate of the force at West Point and its dependencies.
      Thirdly, an estimate of the number of men requisite to man the works.
      Fourthly, a return of the ordnance in the different forts, redoubts, and
      batteries. Fifthly, remarks on the works at West Point, describing the
      construction of each, and its strength or weakness. Sixthly, a report of a
      council of war lately held at headquarters, which contained hints
      respecting the probable operations of the campaign, and which General
      Washington had sent to Arnold a few days before, requesting his opinion on
      the subjects to which it referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the extreme caution, which Arnold had practised on every other
      occasion, particularly in disguising his letters, it is not the least
      remarkable incident in his conspiracy, that papers of this character, by
      far the most important and hazardous that he had communicated, should, in
      his own handwriting, be entrusted to a channel so much exposed to
      accident. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * All these original papers, as they came from André's boots, have been
      carefully preserved, and are now before me. They are copied throughout in
      Arnold's usual handwriting, and their contents are endorsed on the back of
      each in the same hand. To those, who are fond of tracing coincidences, it
      may be a curious fact, that the last canto of André's humorous satire,
      called the "Cow Chace," was first printed on the very day of his capture.
      It will be found in Rivington's Royal Gazette for September 23d, 1780. It
      ends with the following prophetic stanza.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "And now I've closed my epic strain,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I tremble as I show it,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Lest this same warrior-drover, Wayne,

    <p class="indent20">
      Should ever catch the poet."

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      With these papers in his hands, bearing incontestable marks of their
      origin, and procured in a way that indicated most unequivocally the
      designs of the person with whom they were found, Jameson resolved to send
      the prisoner immediately to Arnold! How far he was influenced by the
      persuasion or advice of André is uncertain; but it cannot be doubted, that
      all the address of the latter was used to advance a purpose, which opened
      the only possible door for their escape. Could he proceed to Arnold at
      West Point before the report of his capture should go abroad, it might be
      practicable for them both to get within the British lines, or to take such
      other steps for saving themselves as the extremity of their affairs should
      make necessary. It has been represented, that André's magnanimity was the
      principal motive by which he was actuated in concealing the agency of
      Arnold. His subsequent conduct gives him every claim to the praise of
      honor and nobleness of mind; yet on the present occasion it is obvious,
      that his own personal safety was as much consulted, to say the least, as
      his sentiments of generosity towards his associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jameson penned a hasty line to Arnold, saying merely that he sent forward,
      under the charge of Lieutenant Allen and a guard, a certain John Anderson,
      who had been taken while going towards New York. "He had a passport," said
      Jameson, "signed in your name; and a parcel of papers taken from under his
      stockings, which I think of a very dangerous tendency." He then described
      these papers, and added that he had sent them to General Washington. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * Andre's watch, horse, saddle, and bridle, were claimed by his captors,
      and given up to them. The watch was afterwards bought by Colonel William
      S. Smith for thirty guineas, which, with the money received for the horse,
      saddle, and bridle, were divided equally among the three captors and their
      four companions, who were watching in another place when André was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      There appears to have been some misgiving in the mind of Jameson, although
      he was not prepared to suspect the patriotism and political fidelity of
      his commanding general. Washington said afterwards, that, either on
      account of his "egregious folly, or bewildered conception, he seemed lost
      in astonishment, and not to know what he was doing." This is as lenient a
      judgment, perhaps, as can be passed on his conduct. No one ever doubted
      the purity of his intention. Perceiving the mischievous tendency of the
      papers, and knowing them to have been copied by Arnold, at the same moment
      that he sent André under guard to West Point, he despatched an express
      with the papers to meet General Washington, then supposed to be on the
      road returning from his interview with the French commanders at Hartford.
      Two reasons were subsequently assigned by Jameson for a course, which
      seemed so extraordinary to every body else; first, that he thought the
      affair was an imposition by the British, intended to destroy the
      confidence of the Americans in Arnold; secondly, that, not knowing the
      Vulture was up the river, he supposed Arnold could not get to the enemy
      without passing through the American outposts on the lines, where he would
      be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Tallmadge, next in command under Jameson, was absent on duty below
      White Plains when André was brought in, and did not return till evening.
      He was filled with astonishment when Jameson related what had happened,
      and could not refrain from expressing his surprise at the course that had
      been pursued. To his mind the case was so clear, or at all events was
      attended by such peculiar circumstances, as not only to justify but
      require prompt, bold, and energetic measures on the part of Jameson. In
      short, he declared his suspicions of Arnold, and offered to take on
      himself the entire responsibility of proceeding upon that ground. To this
      idea Jameson would not listen. He was agitated and irresolute at first,
      but finally refused to sanction any measures, which should imply a
      distrust of Arnold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failing in this object, Tallmadge earnestly requested that the prisoner
      might be brought back, to which Jameson with some reluctance consented. As
      the parties from below had been higher up the country than the post at
      North Castle, there was room to apprehend that he might be recaptured, and
      this was probably the prevailing reason with Jameson for countermanding
      his order. Strange as it may seem, however, (if any thing can seem strange
      in such a string of blunders,) he would insist on sending forward the
      letter he had written to Arnold, as will appear by his order of
      countermand to Lieutenant Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From some circumstances, which I have just discovered," said he to that
      officer, "I have reason to fear that a party of the enemy is above; and as
      I would not have Anderson retaken, or get away, I desire that you will
      proceed to Lower Salem with him, and deliver him to Captain Hoogland. You
      will leave the guard with Captain Hoogland, also, except one man, whom you
      may take along. You may proceed to West Point, and deliver the letter to
      General Arnold. You may also show him this, that he may know the reason
      why the prisoner is not sent on. You will please to return as soon as you
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger with this letter overtook Lieutenant Allen, and he came back
      with his charge to North Castle late at night, or early the next morning,
      although from the tenor of the letter it might be inferred, that Colonel
      Jameson supposed he would proceed by some other route to Lower Salem. As
      soon as Major Tallmadge saw the prisoner, and especially when he observed
      his manner of walking to and fro on the floor, and turning on his heel to
      retrace his steps, he was struck with his military deportment, and
      convinced that he had been bred to arms. Jameson gradually came into the
      same way of thinking, though there is no proof of his confidence in Arnold
      having been shaken: but he agreed with Tallmadge, that it was best to keep
      Anderson in close custody, till something more should be known about him,
      or till orders should be received from Arnold or General Washington. As
      Lower Salem was farther within the American lines than North Castle, and
      as Colonel Sheldon's quarters were there, it was thought advisable for him
      to be removed to that place. Major Tallmadge commanded the escort, and
      continued with the prisoner from that time till he arrived at Tappan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered, that, eight or nine days previous to the taking of
      André, a letter had been received by Major Tallmadge from Arnold, in which
      he requested Tallmadge, if a man by the name of Anderson should come
      within the lines, to send him to head-quarters with two horsemen, and to
      bear him company in person if his business would permit. This incident,
      connected with the circumstances of the capture of the prisoner, who
      called himself Anderson, and with the obvious disguise he now assumed,
      confirmed Tallmadge's suspicions, though the nature and extent of the
      plans in agitation he could only conjecture, as Anderson revealed nothing
      and mentioned no names.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the arrival of André at Lower Salem, about eight o'clock in the
      morning, he was introduced to Mr. Bronson, who was attached to Sheldon's
      regiment, and who occupied a small apartment, which he consented to share
      with the prisoner. The room could be easily guarded, as it had but one
      door and one window. André appeared much fatigued, and at first was little
      inclined to talk. His clothes were soiled, and he accepted a change from
      Mr. Bronson, while his linen and nankeen under-dress were sent to the
      washerwoman. Becoming refreshed and more at ease, he relaxed into familiar
      conversation, which, with his agreeable and courteous manners, excited the
      interest and secured the good-will of his room-mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resorted to his favorite resource for amusement, and sketched with a
      pencil a group of ludicrous figures, representing himself and his escort
      under march. He presented the sketch to Bronson, saying, "This will give
      you an idea of the style in which I have had the honor to be conducted to
      my present abode." In diversions of this kind the morning passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was known to André, that the papers found on his person had been
      transmitted to General Washington, who must soon receive them, and it
      being now evident that he would not himself be sent to Arnold, he
      perceived that any further attempts at concealment would be unavailing,
      and resolved to stand forth in his true character, seeking no other
      mitigation of his case, than such as could be granted on the strict
      principles of honor and military usage. With this view he wrote, in
      Bronson's room, his first letter to General Washington, which may properly
      be recorded in this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Salem, 24 September, 1780.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I have as yet said concerning myself was in the justifiable attempt
      to be extricated; I am too little accustomed to duplicity to have
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your Excellency will be persuaded, that no alteration in the temper
      of my mind, or apprehension for my safety, induces me to take the step of
      addressing you; but that it is to rescue myself from an imputation of
      having assumed a mean character for treacherous purposes or self-interest;
      a conduct incompatible with the principles that actuate me, as well as
      with my condition in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is to vindicate my fame that I speak, and not to solicit security.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The person in your possession is Major John André, Adjutant-General to
      the British army.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The influence of one commander in the army of his adversary is an
      advantage taken in war. A correspondence for this purpose I held; as
      confidential (in the present instance) with his Excellency Sir Henry
      Clinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To favor it, I agreed to meet upon ground not within the posts of either
      army a person, who was to give me intelligence; I came up in the Vulture
      man-of-war for this effect, and was fetched by a boat from the ship to the
      beach. Being there, I was told that the approach of day would prevent my
      return, and that I must be concealed until the next night. I was in my
      regimentals, and had fairly risked my person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Against my stipulation, my intention, and without my knowledge
      beforehand, I was conducted within one of your posts. Your Excellency may
      conceive my sensation on this occasion, and will imagine how much more
      must I have been affected by a refusal to reconduct me back the next night
      as I had been brought. Thus become a prisoner, I had to concert my escape.
      I quitted my uniform, and was passed another way in the night, without the
      American posts, to neutral ground, and informed I was beyond all armed
      parties and left to press for New York. I was taken at Tarry town by some
      volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus, as I have had the honor to relate, was I betrayed (being Adjutant
      General of the British army) into the vile condition of an enemy in
      disguise within your posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Having avowed myself a British officer, I have nothing to reveal but what
      relates to myself, which is true on the honor of an officer and a
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The request I have to make to your Excellency, and I am conscious I
      address myself well, is, that in any rigor policy may dictate, a decency
      of conduct towards me may mark, that, though unfortunate, I am branded
      with nothing dishonorable, as no motive could be mine but the service of
      my King, and as I was involuntarily an impostor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another request is, that I may be permitted to write an open letter to
      Sir Henry Clinton, and another to a friend for clothes and linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take the liberty to mention the condition of some gentlemen at
      Charleston, who, being either on parole or under protection, were engaged
      in a conspiracy against us. Though their situation is not similar, they
      are objects who may be set in exchange for me, or are persons whom the
      treatment I receive might affect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no less, Sir, in a confidence of the generosity of your mind, than
      on account of your superior station, that I have chosen to importune you
      with this letter. I have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your
      Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      "JOHN ANDRÉ, Adjutant-General."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished this letter, he handed it open to Major Tallmadge,
      who perused it with astonishment and strong emotion; for, although he
      believed the writer to be a military man, yet he had not supposed him a
      person of such rank, nor dreamed of the dangerous plot in which he had
      been acting a part. The letter was sealed and sent to General Washington.
      From that moment André's mind seemed relieved. He became cheerful, and his
      good humor, affable address, and attractive powers of conversation, gained
      upon the hearts of the officers, and won from them reciprocal kindness and
      civilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this situation let us leave the prisoner for a time, and pursue the
      chain of events in another quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The route travelled by General Washington and his suite to Hartford was
      called the lower road, passing from Peekskill through Danbury. It was
      supposed he would come back the same way; but, without making his
      intention publicly known beforehand, he returned by the upper road, which
      brought him to West Point through the northern parts of the Highlands. He
      arrived at Fishkill, eighteen miles from Arnold's headquarters as the road
      then ran, in the afternoon of the 24th of September. After stopping a
      short time for rest and refreshment, he proceeded onward, and within two
      or three miles of the town met the French minister, M. de la Luzerne, on a
      journey to visit Count de Rochambeau at Newport. As this was an unexpected
      meeting, and the minister expressed an earnest desire to converse with
      General Washington on matters of importance, and urged his return to
      Fishkill for that purpose, he could not with propriety or politeness
      decline the proposal. It had been his design to reach West Point the same
      evening; but this detention left him too little time to attain that
      object, and he remained during the night at Fishkill with the Chevalier de
      la Luzerne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very early in the morning he sent off his baggage, with orders to the men
      who had it in charge to go on with it as quick as they could to General
      Arnold's head-quarters, and give notice that the whole party might be
      expected there to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Washington and the officers, all being on horseback, followed
      immediately, and went on without delay till they came opposite to West
      Point, when Washington's horse was discovered to be turning into a narrow
      road, that led towards the river. Lafayette said to him; "General, you are
      going in a wrong direction; you know Mrs. Arnold is waiting breakfast for
      us, and that road will take us out of our way." Washington answered
      good-naturedly; "Ah, I know you young men are all in love with Mrs.
      Arnold, and wish to get where she is as soon as possible. You may go and
      take your breakfast with her, and tell her not to wait for me. I must ride
      down and examine the redoubts on this side of the river, and will be there
      in a short time." The officers did not choose, however, to take advantage
      of this permission, but continued with the Commander, except two of the
      aids-de-camp, who rode on at the General's request to make known the cause
      of his being detained.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the aids arrived at Arnold's house, they found breakfast waiting, as
      had been supposed. It being now ascertained, that Washington and the other
      gentlemen would not be there, General Arnold, his family, and the
      aids-de-camp, sat down to breakfast. Before they arose from the table, a
      messenger came in with a letter for Arnold, which he broke open and read
      in presence of the company. It was the letter which Colonel Jameson had
      written two days before, and despatched by Lieutenant Allen, and it
      contained the first intelligence received by Arnold of the capture of
      André. His emotion can be more easily imagined than described. So great
      was his control over himself, however, that he concealed it from the
      persons present; and, although he seemed a little agitated for the moment,
      yet not to such a degree as to excite a suspicion, that any thing
      extraordinary had happened. He told the aids-de-camp, that his immediate
      attendance was required at West Point, and desired them to say to General
      Washington when he arrived, that he was unexpectedly called over the river
      and should very soon return. He ordered a horse to be ready, and then,
      leaving the table hastily, he went up to Mrs. Arnold's chamber and sent
      for her. With a brevity demanded by the occasion, he told her that they
      must instantly part, perhaps to meet no more, and that his life depended
      on his reaching the enemy's lines without detection. Struck with horror at
      this intelligence, so abruptly divulged, she swooned and fell senseless.
      In that state he left her, hurried down stairs, mounted a horse belonging
      to one of his aids that stood saddled at the door, and rode alone with all
      speed to the bank of the river. He there entered a boat, and directed the
      oarsmen to push out to the middle of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was rowed by six men, who, having no knowledge of Arnold's
      intentions, promptly obeyed his orders. He quickened their activity by
      saying, that he was going down the river and on board the Vulture with a
      flag, and that he was in great haste, as he expected General Washington at
      his house, and wished to return as expeditiously as possible to meet him
      there. He also added another stimulating motive, by promising them two
      gallons of rum, if they would exert themselves with all their strength. As
      they approached King's Ferry, Arnold exposed to view a white handkerchief,
      and ordered the men to row directly to the Vulture, which was now in
      sight, a little below the place it had occupied when André left it. The
      signal held out by Arnold, while the boat was passing Verplanck's Point,
      caused Colonel Livingston to regard it as a flag-boat, and prevented him
      from ordering it to be stopped and examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat reached the Vulture unobstructed in its passage; and after Arnold
      had gone on board and introduced himself to Captain Sutherland, he called
      the leader of the boatmen into the cabin, and informed him that he and his
      companions were prisoners. The boatman, who had capacity and spirit, said
      they were not prisoners, that they came on board with a flag of truce, and
      under the same sanction they would return. He then appealed to the
      captain, demanding justice and a proper respect for the rules of honor.
      Arnold replied, that all this was nothing to the purpose, that they were
      prisoners and must remain on board. Captain Sutherland, disdaining so
      pitiful an action, though he did not interfere with the positive command
      of Arnold, told the man that he would take his parol, and he might go on
      shore and procure clothes and whatever else was wanted for himself and his
      companions. This was accordingly done the same day. When these men arrived
      in New York, Sir Henry Clinton, holding in just contempt such a wanton act
      of meanness, set them all at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished his inspection at the redoubts, Washington arrived with
      his suite at Arnold's house soon after his precipitate flight to the
      river. When Washington was told, that Arnold had been called over to the
      garrison upon some urgent business, he took a hasty breakfast, and
      concluded not to wait, but to cross immediately to West Point and meet him
      at that place. The officers attended him, except Hamilton, who remained
      behind at the house. It was their arrangement to return to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the whole party were seated in the barge, moving smoothly over the
      water, with the majestic scenery of the Highlands around them, Washington
      said; "Well, Gentlemen, I am glad, on the whole, that General Arnold has
      gone before us, for we shall now have a salute, and the roaring of the
      cannon will have a fine effect among these mountains." The boat drew
      nearer to the beach. No cannon was heard, no appearance of any preparation
      to receive them was visible. "What?" said Washington, "do they not intend
      to salute us?" At this moment an officer was seen winding his way among
      the rocks down the side of the hill, who met the barge as it touched the
      shore, and seemed confused and astonished at the presence of the
      Commander-inchief and the other officers, who were about to honor him with
      a visit. He apologized, and said, if he had expected such visitors, he
      should have been prepared to receive them in a proper manner; but, being
      taken by surprise, he hoped he should be excused for an apparent neglect,
      and for not having put the garrison into a suitable condition for a
      military inspection and review.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Washington was scarcely less surprised, than the commandant
      himself. "How is this, Sir," he inquired; "is not General Arnold here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Sir," replied the officer; "he has not been here these two days, nor
      have I heard from him within that time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is extraordinary," said Washington; "we were told he had crossed the
      river, and that we should find him here. However, our visit must not be in
      vain. Since we have come, although unexpectedly, we must look round a
      little, and see in what state things are with you." Thus saying he went up
      the hill, and was followed by the other officers. They walked to the
      different forts and redoubts, and inspected the garrison in all its parts.
      After completing this task, which took an hour or two, they descended to
      the barge, and were reconducted to the landing-place near Robinson's
      House, from which they had departed.

      <i>Detection of Arnold's Treason.&mdash;André removed to West Point and
      thence to Tappan.&mdash;His Examination by a Board of Officers.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the party
      were on their way from the river to the house, Hamilton was seen walking
      towards them with a quick step and anxious countenance. He came directly
      to Washington, and spoke to him in a low voice, and they retired together
      into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the absence of Washington at West Point, the express had arrived
      with the letter and papers from Jameson, and also with André's letter
      written the day before at Salem. This express had followed the route
      towards Hartford, till he ascertained that General Washington was
      returning by the upper road. He then turned back, and took the shortest
      way to West Point, which passed through Lower Salem; and he thus became
      the bearer of Andre's letter. When the despatches came to Robinson's
      House, as they were represented to be of the utmost importance, Hamilton
      opened them and discovered their contents. These papers he now laid before
      Washington, without hinting the facts they contained to any other person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery was here solved, and the whole extent of the plot was made
      manifest. No uncertainty now existed as to the course Arnold had taken. It
      was clear that he had gone to the enemy. Hamilton was immediately ordered
      to mount a horse and ride to Verplanck's Point, that preparation might be
      made for stopping him, should he not already have passed that post.
      Washington called Lafayette and Knox, to whom he told what had happened,
      and showed the papers. He was perfectly calm, and only said to Lafayette,
      "Whom can we trust now?" For a considerable time no other persons were
      acquainted with the secret, nor did Washington betray in his actions or
      countenance any symptoms of anxiety or excitement. When dinner was
      announced, he said to those around him, "Come, Gentlemen; since Mrs.
      Arnold is unwell, and the General is absent, let us sit down without
      ceremony." The same self-possession and apparent unconcern continued
      through the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time his feelings had been severely tried by the afflicting
      situation of Mrs. Arnold. She was frantic with distress, and seemed on the
      verge of distraction. The scene was vividly described by Hamilton, in a
      letter written the next day. "She, for a considerable time, entirely lost
      herself. The General went up to see her, and she upbraided him with being
      in a plot to murder her child. One moment she raved, another she melted
      into tears. Sometimes she pressed her infant to her bosom and lamented its
      fate, occasioned by the imprudence of its father, in a manner that would
      have pierced insensibility itself. All the sweetness of beauty, all the
      loveliness of innocence, all the tenderness of a wife, and all the
      fondness of a mother, showed themselves in her appearance and conduct. We
      have every reason to believe, that she was entirely unacquainted with the
      plan, and that the first knowledge of it was when Arnold went to tell her
      he must banish himself from his country and from her for ever. She
      instantly fell into convulsions and he left her in that situation." It may
      here be added, that Mrs. Arnold had been only the last ten days at West
      Point, during her husband's command at the post, and that nothing was
      afterwards brought to light, from which it could be inferred that she had
      any knowledge of his traitorous designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Hamilton's mission to Verplanck's Point proved much too late. It
      could hardly have been otherwise, for Arnold had got the start by six
      hours. He left his house about ten o'clock in the morning, and his
      treachery was not known to Washington till nearly four o'clock in the
      afternoon. When Hamilton arrived at Verplanck's Point, a flag of truce was
      coming or had come from the Vulture to that post with a letter from Arnold
      to Washington. This was immediately forwarded, with a note from Hamilton,
      stating that his pursuit had not been successful, and that he should write
      to General Greene advising him to be in readiness to march, and make some
      other arrangements as precautionary measures, although he did not believe
      the project would go on. Nor in truth did it; for the capture of André had
      kept the enemy in ignorance and suspense, till Arnold himself carried the
      news on board the Vulture. Sir Henry Clinton probably knew nothing of the
      matter before the next morning, when the Vulture arrived in New York.
      Hence the plan of an attack was totally frustrated, although every thing
      was prepared for carrying it instantly into effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal object of Arnold's letter to Washington, written on board
      the Vulture, was to solicit protection for his wife, who he said was "as
      good and as innocent as an angel, and incapable of doing wrong." He
      desired that she might be permitted to go to her friends in Philadelphia,
      or to join him, as she should choose. For himself he asked no favor,
      having "too often experienced the ingratitude of his country to attempt
      it;" and moreover he averred, that "the heart conscious of its own
      rectitude" could not descend to palliate an act, which the world might
      think wrong. He talked of his love to his country, and of being actuated
      by that principle in his present conduct. In short, the malignant spirit,
      impudence, and blunted moral feeling, shown in this letter, were
      consistent with his character. Attachment to his wife was the only
      redeeming quality, which seemed not to be extinguished. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * In a postscript to this letter, he said he "thought himself bound in
      honor to declare," that his two aids-de-camp, Major Varick and Major
      Franks, were ignorant of any transactions of his, which they had reason to
      believe were injurious to the public. He included Joshua H. Smith in the
      same exculpatory declaration. Varick and Franks requested a court of
      inquiry to sit for the investigation of their conduct. This was granted by
      the Commander-in-chief, and the result was in every respect most honorable
      to them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enclosed in the same letter was one for Mrs. Arnold, who appeared relieved
      and more tranquil after knowing her husband was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came, also, a letter from Beverly Robinson to Washington, dated on
      board the Vulture. This related to André. It was, in fact, a sort of
      demand for his release. According to Colonel Robinson's conception of the
      affair, André went on shore with a flag of truce, at the request of
      General Arnold, on <i>public business</i>, and had his permit to return to
      New York. "Under these circumstances," said he, "Major André cannot be
      detained by you without the greatest violation of flags, and contrary to
      the custom and usages of all nations." Upon the strength of this argument
      he requested that André might be forthwith set at liberty, and allowed to
      return. He fortified his request by reminding Washington of their "former
      acquaintance"; and, he might have added, an early friendship, for in their
      younger days a close intimacy subsisted between them, which, indeed, was
      severed only by the harsh and uncompromising decrees of war. But however
      faithful in his friendships, Washington never suffered them for a moment
      to influence his stern sense of public duty, to stifle the voice of truth,
      or avert the awards of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being wholly ignorant of the extent of Arnold's plans, and not knowing the
      degree of maturity to which they had been brought, or what persons might
      be involved with him, Washington's first steps were to provide for the
      security of the garrison and its dependencies. He wrote immediately to the
      principal officer at West Point, and to others commanding detachments in
      the neighborhood, giving them explicit orders, and making the best
      arrangements for resistance in case of an attack. He sent an express to
      General Greene, who commanded the army near Tappan in the absence of the
      Commander-in-chief, and directed him to put the left wing in motion as
      soon as possible, and march towards King's Ferry, where, or on the way, he
      would be met with further orders. The express reached General Greene's
      quarters at midnight. The left division was instantly called to arms, and
      the march commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary for Washington to exercise much delicacy on this
      occasion, as well as great decision and energy. He knew not who were
      friends or foes. Having no clew as yet, which could lead him to a
      discovery of the secret designs and acts of the traitor, prudence required
      him to be on his guard and sparing of his confidence to persons, whose
      situation and recent intimacy with Arnold would give countenance to the
      supposition, that they might be in this plot. But, on the contrary, to
      show distrust of those, who did not deserve it, would be cruel in itself,
      and might have injurious consequences. He pursued a course, which was the
      most agreeable to his own feelings, and fortunately it was the best that
      could have been adopted. Apparently he put an unreserved confidence in all
      the officers, and in no instance manifested the least symptom of doubt as
      to their fidelity or patriotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of Colonel Livingston is worthy of notice. He commanded at
      Verplanck's Point, and from the proximity of his post to the enemy, and
      several concurring circumstances, might be very fairly presumed to have
      been either directly or indirectly concerned in Arnold's manoeuvres. By a
      very laconic letter, Washington ordered that officer to come to him
      immediately. Livingston expected, at least, a severe scrutiny into his
      conduct, being fully aware, though conscious of his innocence, that
      circumstances were unfavorable. But Washington made no inquiries into the
      past, nor uttered a syllable that implied distrust. He told Colonel
      Livingston, that he had sent for him to give him very special orders, to
      impress upon him the danger of his post and the necessity of vigilance,
      and to communicate other particulars, which could only be done in a
      personal interview. In conclusion he said it was a source of gratification
      to him, that the post was in the hands of an officer, whose courage and
      devotedness to the cause of his country afforded a pledge of a faithful
      and honorable discharge of duty. Let the reader imagine the grateful
      emotions of Colonel Livingston, his increased esteem for his commander,
      and the alacrity with which, under such an impulse, he went back to his
      station of high trust and danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time that these preparations were making for the security of
      West Point, an order was despatched to Colonel Jameson, directing him to
      send André under a strong guard to Robinson's House. The express arrived
      about midnight at Lower Salem, and at that hour an officer came with the
      message to André. He started up quickly from his bed, and obeyed the
      summons. The rain fell in torrents, and the night was dark and dismal. Mr.
      Bronson says, that, on taking leave, he expressed a deep sense of the
      obligations he was under, for the delicate and courteous treatment he had
      received from the officers of the regiment with whom he had become
      acquainted, and declared that, whatever might be his future destiny, he
      could never meet them as enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard marched all night, and in the morning of the next day, September
      26th, André arrived at Robinson's House, in the custody of Major
      Tallmadge. Many inquiries were made by Washington; but he declined having
      the prisoner brought into his presence, and Major Tallmadge believes, that
      Washington never saw him while he was in the hands of the Americans. André
      was taken over to West Point the same evening, where he remained till the
      morning of the 28th, when he was removed down the river in a barge to
      Stony Point, and thence under an escort of cavalry to Tappan. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * Joshua H. Smith was arrested at Fishkill, in the night of the 25th of
      September, by Colonel Gouvion, a French officer, whom Washington sent for
      that purpose. Smith was conducted under guard to West Point, and from that
      place to Tappan, where he was kept in confinement till he was tried by a
      court-martial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The events of this day's march have been narrated in a manner so
      impressive and so interesting by Major Tallmadge, that they ought not to
      be presented in any other language than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the moment," says Major Tallmadge, "that André made the disclosure
      of his name and true character, in his letter to the Commander-in-chief,
      which he handed to me as soon as he had written it, down to the moment of
      his execution, I was almost constantly with him. I walked with him to the
      place of execution, and parted with him under the gallows, overwhelmed
      with grief, that so gallant an officer and so accomplished a gentleman
      should come to such an ignominious end. The ease and affability of his
      manners, polished by the refinement of good society and a finished
      education, made him a most delightful companion. It often drew tears from
      my eyes to find him so agreeable in conversation on different subjects,
      when I reflected on his future fate, and that too, as I believed, so near
      at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you ask for private anecdotes, I would remark, that, soon after our
      first acquaintance, being mutually disposed to indulge in the most
      unreserved and free conversation, and both being soldiers of equal rank in
      the two armies, we agreed on a cartel, by the terms of which each one was
      permitted to put any question to the other, not involving a third person.
      This opened a wide field for two inquisitive young officers, and we amused
      ourselves not a little on the march to head-quarters. Many anecdotes
      doubtless were related, which the lapse of more than fifty-three years has
      consigned to oblivion, and which I have no desire again to recollect. My
      principal object was to learn the course of the late plot. On every point
      that I inquired about, where any other person was concerned, he maintained
      most rigidly the rule; so that when that most infamous traitor, Arnold,
      was concerned and he out of our control, so nice was Andre's sense of
      honor, that he would disclose nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we left West Point for Tappan, early in the morning, as we passed
      down the Hudson River to King's Ferry, I placed André by my side, on the
      after seat of the barge. I soon began to make inquiries about the expected
      capture of our fortress then in full view, and begged him to inform me
      whether he was to have taken a part in the military attack, if Arnold's
      plan had succeeded. He instantly replied in the affirmative, and pointed
      me to a table of land on the west shore, which he said was the spot where
      he should have landed, at the head of a select corps. He then traversed in
      idea the course up the mountain into the rear of Fort Putnam, which
      overlooks the whole parade of West Point. And this he did with much
      greater exactness, than I could have done; and, as Arnold had so disposed
      of the garrison, that little or no opposition could be made by our troops,
      Major André supposed he should have reached that commanding eminence
      without difficulty. In such case that important key of our country would
      have been theirs (the enemy's), and the glory of so splendid an
      achievement would have been his. The animation with which he gave the
      account, I recollect, perfectly delighted me, for he seemed as if he was
      entering the fort sword in hand. To complete the climax, I next inquired
      what was to have been his reward, if he had succeeded. He replied that
      military glory was all he sought; and that the thanks of his general, and
      the approbation of his King, were a rich reward for such an undertaking. I
      think he further remarked, that, if he had succeeded, (and, with the aid
      of the opposing general, who could doubt of success?) he was to have been
      promoted to the rank of a brigadier-general.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After we disembarked at King's Ferry, near Haverstraw, we took up our
      line of march, with a fine body of horse for Tappan. Before we reached the
      Clove, Major André became very inquisitive to know my opinion as to the
      result of his capture. In other words, he wished me to give him candidly
      my opinion, as to the light in which he would be viewed by General
      Washington, and a military tribunal, if one should be ordered. This was
      the most unpleasant question that had been propounded to me, and I
      endeavored to evade it, unwilling to give him a true answer. When I could
      no longer evade his importunity, or put off a full reply, I remarked to
      him as follows. 'I had a much loved class-mate in Yale College, by the
      name of Nathan Hale, who entered the army in the year 1775. Immediately
      after the battle of Long Island, General Washington wanted information
      respecting the strength, position, and probable movements of the enemy.
      Captain Hale tendered his services, went over to Brooklyn, and was taken
      just as he was passing the outposts of the enemy on his return.' Said I
      with emphasis, 'Do you remember the sequel of this story?' 'Yes,' said
      André, 'he was hanged as a spy. But you surely do not consider his case
      and mine alike?' I replied, 'Yes, precisely similar, and similar will be
      your fate.' He endeavored to answer my remarks, but it was manifest he was
      more troubled in spirit than I had ever seen him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We stopped at the Clove to dine, and to let the horse-guard refresh.
      While there, André kept reviewing his shabby dress, and finally remarked
      to me, that he was positively ashamed to go to the head-quarters of the
      American army in such a plight. I called my servant, and directed him to
      bring my dragoon cloak, which I presented to Major André. This he refused
      to take for some time; but I insisted on it, and he finally put it on, and
      rode in it to Tappan."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Washington's letter to General Greene, informing him that the prisoners
      would be sent to camp, and giving instructions as to the manner in which
      they were to be guarded, he said, "I wish the room for Major André to be a
      decent one, and that he may be treated with civility." And even Smith, who
      writes with much asperity against Washington and nearly all the American
      officers, confesses, that "Major André was comfortably lodged, and every
      attention was paid to him suitable to his rank and character." Indeed,
      such was the sympathy already excited everywhere for this accomplished
      young man, heightened by a detestation of Arnold, that even his enemies,
      whom he had sought to ruin by leaguing with a traitor, regarded him rather
      in the light of a martyr, than as a victim of his own imprudence,
      ambition, and love of glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      All necessary arrangements having been made for the security of West
      Point, Washington hastened to the army. The next day after his arrival,
      September 29th, he summoned a board of general officers, directing them to
      examine into the case of Major André, report a precise state of the same,
      and give their opinion, as to the light in which he ought to be regarded,
      and the punishment that should be inflicted. This board consisted of six
      major-generals, and eight brigadiers. General Greene was the President.
      Let it be observed, that the board was not a court-martial, but merely a
      court of inquiry, instructed to examine and report facts, and to express
      an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sundry papers were laid before the board, particularly those already
      mentioned as relating to this subject. There were also two other letters.
      One was written to Washington by Sir Henry Clinton, as soon as he heard of
      André's capture, on the return of the Vulture to New York. It contained a
      brief request, that the King's adjutant-general might have permission to
      return immediately to his orders. This request was sustained by a letter
      from Arnold to him, a copy of which was forwarded, and in which Arnold
      said, that André had acted in all respects conformably to his directions,
      and was under his protection during the whole time he was within the
      American lines; that he had sent a flag of truce to bring him on shore,
      had given him papers in his own handwriting, directed him to assume a
      feigned name, and furnished him with passports to go by the way of White
      Plains to New York. As all these acts were done while he had command,
      Arnold inferred, that he had a right to do them, and that, if any thing
      was wrong, the responsibility rested with him, and not with Major André.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board assembled, and the prisoner was brought before them. The names
      of the officers constituting the board were read to him. Before the
      examination commenced, General Greene told him that various questions
      would be asked, but the board desired him to feel at perfect liberty to
      answer them or not, as he might choose, and to take his own time for
      recollection and for weighing what he said. André then proceeded to give a
      brief narrative of what occurred between the time of his coming on shore
      and that of his capture, which agreed in every point with his letter to
      General Washington. He also confessed that certain papers, which were
      shown to him, were the same that had been concealed in his boots, and that
      a pass for John Anderson, in the handwriting of Arnold, was the one he had
      exhibited to his captors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being interrogated as to his conception of the manner in which he came on
      shore, and whether he considered himself under a flag, he answered, that
      "it was impossible for him to suppose he came on shore under the sanction
      of a flag, and added, that, if he came on shore under that sanction, he
      might certainly have returned under it." Throughout his examination Major
      André maintained a manly, dignified, and respectful deportment, replied to
      every question promptly, discovered no embarrassment, sought no disguise,
      stated with frankness and truth every thing that related to himself, and
      used no words to explain, palliate, or defend any part of his conduct. So
      delicate was he in regard to other persons, that he scrupulously avoided
      mentioning names, or alluding to any particulars except such as concerned
      himself. General Greene spoke of Smith's House, in reference to the place
      of meeting between André and Arnold. "I said a house, Sir," replied André,
      "but I did not say whose house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," answered Greene, "nor have we any right to demand this of you,
      after the conditions we have allowed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The examination being closed, Major André was asked whether he had any
      remarks to make on the statements that had been presented. He replied in
      the negative, and said he should leave them to operate with the board. He
      was then remanded to the place of his confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a full consideration of the subject, taking into view the papers
      that had been laid before them, and the voluntary confessions of Major
      André, the board reported the following facts;
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, that he came on shore from the Vulture sloop-of-war, in the night,
      on an interview with General Arnold, in a private and secret manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Secondly, that he changed his dress within our lines, and, under a
      feigned name and in a disguised habit, passed our works at Stony and
      Verplanck's Points; was taken at Tarrytown in a disguised habit, being
      then on his way to New York; and, when taken, he had in his possession
      several papers, which contained intelligence for the enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Believing these facts to be established, the board further reported it as
      their opinion, that Major André ought to be considered as a spy, and,
      according to the law and usage of nations, to suffer death.
    </p>
    <p>
      This decision was communicated to the prisoner, who, at his request, was
      permitted to write a letter to Sir Henry Clinton, which follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tappan, 29 September, 1780.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir,

    <p>
      "Your Excellency is doubtless already apprized of the manner in which I
      was taken, and possibly of the serious light in which my conduct is
      considered, and the rigorous determination that is impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under these circumstances, I have obtained General Washington's
      permission to send you this letter; the object of which is, to remove from
      your breast any suspicion, that I could imagine I was bound by your
      Excellency's orders to expose myself to what has happened. The events of
      coming within an enemy's posts, and of changing my dress, which led me to
      my present situation, were contrary to my own intentions, as they were to
      your orders; and the circuitous route, which I took to return, was imposed
      (perhaps unavoidably) without alternative upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am perfectly tranquil in mind, and prepared for any fate, to which an
      honest zeal for my King's service may have devoted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In addressing myself to your Excellency on this occasion, the force of
      all my obligations to you, and of the attachment and gratitude I bear you,
      recurs to me. With all the warmth of my heart, I give you thanks for your
      Excellency's profuse kindness to me; and I send you the most earnest
      wishes for your welfare, which a faithful, affectionate, and respectful
      attendant can frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a mother and two sisters, to whom the value of my commission would
      be an object, as the loss of Grenada has much affected their income. It is
      needless to be more explicit on this subject; I am persuaded of your
      Excellency's goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I receive the greatest attention from his Excellency General Washington,
      and from every person under whose charge I happen to be placed. I have the
      honor to be, with the most respectful attachment, your Excellency's most
      obedient and most humble servant,

      "JOHN ANDRÉ, Adjutant-General."
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter was accompanied by one from General Washington to Sir Henry
      Clinton, and by a copy of the proceedings of the board of officers.
      Washington's letter was short, stating, in reply to the British
      commander's request respecting his adjutant-general, that, although he was
      taken under circumstances, which warranted the most summary mode of
      treatment, yet great moderation had been exercised towards him, and his
      case had been referred to a board of general officers, whose report was
      then transmitted for Sir Henry's inspection; from which it would be seen,
      that Major André was engaged in executing measures very different from the
      objects of a flag of truce, and such as a flag could not by any possible
      construction ever have been intended to authorize or countenance.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>otwithstanding the
      equity of the sentence against André, and the irresistible testimony upon
      which it was founded, his rank and character excited so lively an interest
      in every breast, and there were so many extenuating circumstances
      connected with the manner in which he had been seduced into the snare,
      that the voice of humanity pleaded loudly in his behalf, and the sternest
      advocate for justice could not regard his impending fate without regret,
      or a wish that it might be averted. No one was more deeply impressed with
      these feelings than Washington; and his anxiety was the greater, as the
      final determination of punishment or acquittal must rest with him.
      Washington never shrunk from a public duty, yet his heart was humane, and
      his mind revolted at the thought of being the agent in an act, which
      wounded his sensibility, although impelled by the laws of war, a sense of
      right, and an approving conscience. The treachery of Arnold had been so
      atrocious, so unexpected and artfully contrived, and the example was so
      dangerous, that the most signal punishment was necessary, not more as a
      retribution due to the crime, and a terror to others, who might harbor
      similar designs, than as a proof to the people, that their cause was not
      to be left to the mercy of traitors, nor sacrificed with impunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this view of the subject, the only one in which it could be regarded by
      wisdom, prudence, or patriotism, there was but one possible mode of saving
      André; and that was to exchange him for Arnold, who should himself be held
      responsible for the criminal transactions, which had originated with him,
      and in which he had been the chief actor. That the enemy would give him up
      was hardly to be expected, nor could a formal proposition of that kind be
      advanced; yet there was no reason why the opportunity should not be
      offered, or at least why it should not be intimated to them, that in such
      an event André would be released. To effect this object the following plan
      was adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington sent for Captain Aaron Ogden, whom he informed that he had
      selected him to carry despatches to the British post at Paulus Hook, which
      were to be conveyed thence across the river to New York. After putting the
      packet of papers into his hands, and giving him some general directions as
      to the mode of arranging the escort, so that it should consist of men
      whose fidelity could be relied upon, and who should make a good
      appearance, he told Ogden to call on the Marquis de Lafayette for
      additional instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was on the 30th of September, the day after the examination of André,
      and the packet intrusted to Ogden contained his letter to Sir Henry
      Clinton, and that mentioned above from Washington to the same commander.
      Lafayette was at the head of the Light Infantry, who were stationed in
      advance of the army towards the enemy's lines. He instructed Ogden so to
      contrive his march, that he should arrive at Paulus Hook so late in the
      day, that he would be asked to stay all night. He was then to seek a
      favorable moment to communicate to the commandant of the post, or some of
      the principal officers, as if incidentally, the idea about exchanging
      André for Arnold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus prepared, Ogden set off with a suitable escort, and at a convenient
      hour arrived at the outposts near Paulus Hook. He was there stopped, and
      the officer proposed to detain him, till the despatches were sent in and
      an answer returned. Captain Ogden assured him, that he had express orders
      to deliver the packet into the hands of the principal officer of the post,
      and upon this representation he was allowed to pass. The commandant was
      courteous, received the packet, and immediately sent it by an express
      across the river to New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Ogden was politely asked to take supper with the officers; and
      when the evening was far advanced and the boat did not come back, he was
      invited to remain through the night. The conversation turned upon André,
      and the commandant inquired whether he thought Washington would consent to
      his execution. Ogden replied, that he undoubtedly would, that the army
      expected it, and the nature of the offence rendered it necessary; and,
      whatever might be his private feelings, and however painful the task, he
      would not hesitate to do his duty promptly, when required by justice and
      the laws of war, and when the vital interests of his country were at
      stake. The commandant asked, if there was no way of preventing such a
      catastrophe. "Yes," replied Ogden, "it is in the power of Sir Henry
      Clinton to do it. If he will deliver up Arnold into the hands of the
      Americans, and take André in exchange, the prisoner may have a speedy
      rescue." Ogden was then asked whether he had authority for such a
      declaration. "I have no such assurance from General Washington," said he,
      "but I am prepared to say, that if such a proposal were to be made, I
      believe it would be accepted, and Major André set at liberty." Upon this
      hint the officer left the company, crossed the river, had an interview
      with Sir Henry Clinton, and returned before morning. He told Captain
      Ogden, that such a thing could not be done; that to give up a man, who had
      deserted from the enemy, and openly espoused the King's cause, was such a
      violation of honor and every military principle, that Sir Henry Clinton
      would not listen to the idea for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The despatch-boat came back, and Ogden prepared at the dawn of day for his
      departure. On mustering his men, it was discovered, that the sergeant of
      the escort was missing, and it was supposed he had deserted to the enemy
      during the night. Having no time for search, Ogden hastened to General
      Washington's camp, and delivered the packet he had brought. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * This desertion of the sergeant was a stratagem of Washington unknown to
      Captain Ogden at the time. A paper had been intercepted, in which was
      found the name of one of the American major-generals, connected in such a
      manner with other particulars, as to excite a suspicion, that he was
      concerned in Arnold's treason. It was extremely important, that this point
      should be ascertained; and the sergeant was prevailed upon to desert, and
      act as a spy in New York to gain intelligence of a certain kind, and from
      certain sources. The stratagem was successful, and the intelligence sent
      out by the sergeant, in a very short time, proved incontestably that the
      suspicion was entirely groundless. The intercepted paper was probably
      designed by the enemy to fall into General Washington's hands, and to
      create jealousy and discord among the American officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters from André and General Washington, and the proceedings of the
      board of examination, were perused with much concern by Sir Henry Clinton.
      He immediately assembled a council of general officers, and laid these
      papers before them. After maturely considering their contents, it was
      resolved that a deputation of three persons should proceed to the nearest
      American outpost, furnished with evidence to prove Major André's
      innocence, and to impart information, which Sir Henry Clinton thought
      would place the question in a different light from that in which it had
      been viewed by the American board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The persons delegated on this mission were General Robertson, Andrew
      Elliot, and William Smith. They were accompanied by Beverly Robinson as a
      witness in the case, and were fortified in their estimation, but weakened
      in reality, by a long explanatory and threatening letter from Arnold to
      General Washington. The commissioners went up the river in the Greyhound
      Schooner, with a flag of truce, on the 1st of October. Notice of the
      intended visit and its objects had been already communicated by Sir Henry
      Clinton to Washington; and when the vessel anchored at Dobbs's Ferry,
      General Greene was there, having been deputed by Washington to hold the
      interview in his behalf. The person sent on shore by the British
      commissioners brought word back, that General Robertson only would be
      permitted to land, and that General Greene was then in readiness to
      receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference was opened by Robertson, who paid some compliments to the
      American general, and expressed the satisfaction he had in treating with
      him on an occasion so interesting to the two armies and to humanity.
      Greene replied, that it was necessary for them to know at the outset on
      what ground they stood; that he was not there in the character of an
      officer; that he was allowed by General Washington to meet him as a
      private gentleman, but that the case of an acknowledged spy admitted of no
      discussion. Robertson said his design was to state facts, which he hoped
      would have their due weight, in whatever character he might be supposed to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then entered largely into the subject, endeavoring to show, first, that
      André landed under the sanction of a flag; secondly, that he acted wholly
      by the directions of Arnold; from both of which positions it was inferred,
      that he could not in any just sense of the word be regarded as a spy. The
      facts having all been examined by the board of officers, and been well
      understood, this new statement of them made no change in Greene's opinion
      or impressions; and when Arnold's testimony was introduced, he said the
      Americans would believe André in preference to Arnold. General Robertson
      said, that no military tribunal in Europe would decide the case of André
      to be that of a spy, and he proposed to refer the question to Count de
      Rochambeau and General Knyphausen. Other considerations were urged by him,
      not so much in the way of argument, as on the score of reciprocal benefits
      and humanity. He added, that he should confide in General Greene's candor
      to represent in the fairest light to General Washington the arguments he
      had used; that he should stay on board all night, and hoped in the morning
      to take back with him Major André, or an assurance of his safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Robertson's despatch to Sir Henry Clinton, containing the particulars
      of the conference, he said it was intimated to him by Greene, that, if
      André were set free, it would be expected that Arnold should be given up.
      Robertson professed to have replied to this intimation only by a look of
      indignant rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter from Arnold to General Washington, written to aid the
      negotiation of the commissioners, was extraordinary, considering the
      purpose it was intended to answer. After expressing his "grateful
      acknowledgments and thanks" for the kindness shown to Mrs. Arnold, and
      attempting to screen André from blame by taking the responsibility of his
      deeds upon himself, and declaring that he "had an undoubted right to
      transact all those matters," he concludes in a style of hardened impudence
      and malignity, that, even when coming from such a source, must be regarded
      with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If, after this just and candid representation of Major Andre's case,"
      said he, "the board of general officers adhere to their former opinion, I
      shall suppose it dictated by passion and resentment; and if that gentleman
      should suffer the severity of their sentence, I shall think myself bound
      by every tie of duty and honor to retaliate on such unhappy persons of
      your army as may fall within my power, that the respect due to flags, and
      to the law of nations, may be better understood and observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this warning should be disregarded, and he suffer, I call Heaven and
      earth to witness, that your Excellency will be justly answerable for the
      torrent of blood, that may be spilt in consequence."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hardly possible that this letter could have been seen by Sir Henry
      Clinton, although written at his request, with the view of operating on
      the judgment and clemency of Washington. Could any language, uttered by
      any individual, have a more opposite tendency? Disgust and contempt were
      the only emotions it could excite; and it was at least an evidence, that
      neither the understanding nor the heart of the writer had been improved by
      his political change. Hitherto he had discovered acuteness and mental
      resource, but in this act his folly was commensurate with his wickedness.
      At the same time he performed the farce of resigning his commission, as an
      officer in the American service, and wrote to General Washington, "I beg
      leave to assure your Excellency, that my attachment to the true interests
      of my country is invariable, and that I am actuated by the same principle,
      which has ever been the governing rule of my conduct in this unhappy
      contest." Setting aside the hypocrisy of this declaration, it is perhaps
      fair to interpret it in its literal sense, and to believe, that he had
      always confounded patriotism with selfishness, and the interests of his
      country with the aims of a mercenary ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British commissioners waited till morning, as General Robertson had
      proposed, and at an early hour they received a note from General Greene,
      stating that he had communicated to Washington the substance of the
      conference, but that it had produced no change in his opinion and
      determination. This intelligence was astounding to Robertson; for he had
      written to Sir Henry Clinton the evening before, that he was persuaded
      André would not be harmed. How he got this impression is not easily
      discovered, since he represented General Greene as obstinately bent on
      considering André as a spy, and resisting all his arguments to the
      contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more could be done by the commissioners. That no measure might be
      left untried, however, General Robertson wrote a letter to Washington,
      containing a summary of the topics he had discussed at the conference, and
      assigned as a reason for sending it, that he feared General Greene's
      memory might have failed him in some particulars, and he wished the merits
      of so important a case to be presented with all the clearness and force it
      deserved. This letter could have produced no effect, even if it had not
      arrived too late; for it touched upon no points, which had not already
      been examined and decided. The commissioners returned to New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in confinement at Tappan, both before and after his sentence, André
      had shown the greatest composure, and the same serenity of temper and
      winning gentleness of manners, that had been conspicuous in his
      conversation and deportment from the time he was taken. His regimentals
      had been brought from New York by his servant, after his arrival at
      Tappan, and he appeared in the full dress of a British officer. Colonel
      Hamilton, in his beautiful and pathetic letter to Colonel Laurens,
      respecting the capture and death of André, has described an incident in
      his conduct on this occasion, which would add lustre to his name, even if
      it were not adorned by genius, magnanimity, and honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one of the visits I made to him," said Hamilton, "(and I saw him
      several times during his confinement,) he begged me to be the bearer of a
      request to the General, for permission to send an open letter to Sir Henry
      Clinton. 'I foresee my fate,' said he, 'and though I pretend not to play
      the hero, or to be indifferent about life, yet I am reconciled to whatever
      may happen, conscious that misfortune, not guilt, has brought it upon me.
      There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquillity. Sir Henry Clinton
      has been too good to me; he has been lavish of his kindness; I am bound to
      him by too many obligations, and love him too well, to bear the thought
      that he should reproach himself, or others should reproach him, on the
      supposition of my having conceived myself obliged, by his instructions, to
      run the risk I did. I would not, for the world, leave a sting in his mind
      that should embitter his future days.' He could scarce finish the
      sentence, bursting into tears, in spite of his efforts to suppress them,
      and with difficulty collected himself enough afterwards to add, 'I wish to
      be permitted to assure him, I did not act under this impression, but
      submitted to a necessity imposed upon me, as contrary to my own
      inclination, as to his orders.' His request was readily complied with, and
      he wrote the letter annexed, with which I dare say you will be as much
      pleased as I am, both for the sentiment and diction."
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter was the same that has been inserted above, and its contents
      accord in every respect with the delicacy of feeling and warmth of
      gratitude here expressed towards his benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sentence of the board was announced to André, he manifested no
      surprise or concern, having evidently been prepared by his own reflections
      for this result. He remarked only, that, since he was to die, "there was
      still a choice in the mode, which would make a material difference in his
      feelings." It was his wish to die the death of a soldier, and he requested
      that he might be shot. The application was renewed in a letter addressed
      to General Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tappan, 1 October, 1780.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buoyed above the terror of death, by the consciousness of a life devoted
      to honorable pursuits, and stained with no action that can give me
      remorse, I trust that the request I make to your Excellency at this
      serious period, and which is to soften my last moments, will not be
      rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sympathy towards a soldier will surely induce your Excellency, and a
      military tribunal, to adapt the mode of my death to the feelings of a man
      of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me hope, Sir, that if aught in my character impresses you with esteem
      towards me, if aught in my misfortunes marks me as the victim of policy
      and not of resentment, I shall experience the operation of these feelings
      in your breast, by being informed that I am not to die on a gibbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the honor to be your Excellency's most obedient and most humble
      servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      "JOHN ANDRÉ."
    </p>
    <p>
      The indulgence here solicited, in terms as manly as they are persuasive
      and touching, could not be granted consistently with the customs of war.
      Such, at least, was the opinion of Washington and of the officers he
      consulted. No answer was returned either to the first application or to
      the letter, it being deemed more humane to evade a reply, than to cause
      the painful sensations, which a positive refusal would inflict. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * There is still in existence a curious memorial both of the person of
      Major André, and of his tranquillity and self-possession, during this
      period of trial and solemn anticipation. In the midst of the sombre
      thoughts, which must have thronged upon his mind, he resorted to the art,
      which had given him so much delight, when all the opening prospects of
      life were gilded with hope and gladness. The following is an extract from
      a letter, written by Mr. Ebenezer Baldwin to the President of Yale
      College, and dated at New Haven, August 8th, 1832.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It affords me pleasure, as the agent of Mr. Jabez L. Tomlinson of
      Stratford, and of Mr. Nathan Beers of this city, to request your
      acceptance of the accompanying miniature of Major John André. It is his
      likeness seated at a table in his guard-room, and drawn by himself with a
      pen, on the morning of the day fixed for his execution. Mr. Tomlinson
      informs me, that a respite was granted until the next day, and that this
      miniature was in the mean time presented to him (then acting as officer of
      the guard) by Major André himself Mr. Tomlinson was present when the
      sketch was made, and says it was drawn without the aid of a glass. The
      sketch subsequently passed into the hands of Mr. Beers, a fellow-officer
      of Mr. Tomlinson on the station, and from thence was transferred to me. It
      has been in my possession several years."
    </p>
    <p>
      The original drawing is now in the Trumbull Gallery at Yale College. It
      bears a strong resemblance to an engraved head of André printed in
      England, and the likeness may be presumed to approach as near to accuracy,
      as is usual in miniatures of the same size; more especially as André was
      accustomed to draw similar sketches of himself for his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time for the execution was at first fixed at five o'clock in the
      afternoon of the day, on which Greene had the interview with Robertson,
      and it was thus published in the general orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the length of that negotiation caused the execution to be deferred
      till the next day, October 2d, at twelve o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particulars of this event will be here related in the language of Dr.
      Thacher, who was an eye-witness and evidently a close observer, and who
      has described what he saw with a precision and force, which bear the stamp
      of accuracy and present a vivid picture of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The principal guard-officer, who was constantly in the room with the
      prisoner, relates, that when the hour of his execution was announced to
      him in the morning, he received it without emotion, and, while all present
      were affected with silent gloom, he retained a firm countenance, with
      calmness and composure of mind. Observing his servant enter the room in
      tears, he exclaimed, 'Leave me till you can show yourself more manly.' His
      breakfast being sent to him from the table of General Washington, which
      had been done every day of his confinement, he partook of it as usual, and
      having shaved and dressed himself, he placed his hat on the table, and
      cheerfully said to the guard-officers, 'I am ready at any moment,
      Gentlemen, to wait on you.' The fatal hour having arrived, a large
      detachment of troops was paraded, and an immense concourse of people
      assembled; almost all our general and field officers, excepting his
      Excellency and his staff, were present on horseback; melancholy and gloom
      pervaded all ranks; the scene was affecting and awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was so near during the solemn march to the fatal spot, as to observe
      every movement and participate in every emotion, which the melancholy
      scene was calculated to produce. Major André walked from the stone house,
      in which he had been confined, between two of our subaltern officers, arm
      in arm; the eyes of the immense multitude were fixed on him, who, rising
      superior to the fear of death, appeared as if conscious of the dignified
      deportment which he displayed. He betrayed no want of fortitude, but
      retained a complacent smile on his countenance, and politely bowed to
      several gentlemen whom he knew, which was respectfully returned. It was
      his earnest desire to be shot, as being the mode of death most conformable
      to the feelings of a military man, and he had indulged the hope that his
      request would be granted. At the moment, therefore, when suddenly he came
      in view of the gallows, he involuntarily started backward, and made a
      pause. 'Why this emotion, Sir?' said an officer by his side. Instantly
      recovering his composure, he said, 'I am reconciled to my death, but I
      detest the mode.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "While waiting and standing near the gallows, I observed some degree of
      trepidation; placing his foot on a stone, and rolling it over, and choking
      in his throat, as if attempting to swallow. So soon, however, as he
      perceived that things were in readiness, he stepped quickly into the
      wagon, and at this moment he appeared to shrink, but instantly elevating
      his head with firmness, he said, 'It will be but a momentary pang;' and
      taking from his pocket two white handkerchiefs, the provost marshal with
      one loosely pinioned his arms, and with the other, the victim, after
      taking off his hat and stock, bandaged his own eyes with perfect firmness,
      which melted the hearts, and moistened the cheeks, not only of his
      servant, but of the throng of spectators. The rope being appended to the
      gallows, he slipped the noose over his head, and adjusted it to his neck,
      without the assistance of the executioner. Colonel Scammell now informed
      him, that he had an opportunity to speak, if he desired it. He raised the
      handkerchief from his eyes, and said, 'I pray you to bear me witness, that
      I meet my fate like a brave man.' The wagon being now removed from under
      him, he was suspended and instantly expired." *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * Thacher's Military Journal, p. 222.&mdash;In a more recent publication,
      entitled Observations relating to the Execution of Major André, first
      printed in the New England Magazine, Dr. Thacher has added several facts
      illustrative of that event. Appended to the same is an interesting letter
      by Major Benjamin Russell, who was one of the inner guard, that attended
      André to the place of execution, and walked so near him as to hear
      distinctly what he said. The outer guard consisted of about five hundred
      men; the inner guard was only a captain's command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the whole of this scene, from the time he left the house in
      which he was guarded, till the last fatal moment, his demeanor was such as
      to excite the respect, sympathy, and sorrow of every beholder. His step
      was steady, his carriage easy and graceful, his countenance placid, but
      thoughtful and firm, indicating a solemn sense of his impending fate, and
      a resolution to meet it in a manner consistent with his character and the
      previous tenor of his conduct. He was dressed in the uniform of a British
      officer. When life had departed, the body was taken down and interred
      within a few yards of the place of execution. The coat and other
      regimentals were given to his servant, who faithfully attended him to the
      last, and saw the grave close over his mortal remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the death of a man, whose rare accomplishments had procured for
      him the friendship and confidence of all to whom he was known, and opened
      the happiest presages of a future career of renown and glory. In ten short
      days his blooming hopes had been blighted, and his glowing visions
      dispersed. But it was his singular fortune to die, not more beloved by his
      friends, than lamented by his enemies, whose cause he had sought to ruin,
      and by whose hands his life was justly taken. Time has consecrated the
      feeling. There are few Americans, and few will there ever be, who can look
      back upon the fate of André without deep regret. His name is embalmed in
      every generous heart; and they, who shall condemn his great error and
      applaud the sentence of his judges, will cherish a melancholy remembrance
      of the unfortunate victim, and grieve that a life of so much promise,
      adorned with so many elevated and estimable qualities, was destined to an
      untimely and ignominious end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this event, when the facts had not yet become fully known or
      duly weighed, a few British writers allowed themselves to remark with much
      freedom and asperity respecting the part taken by Washington. They said
      the sentence was harsh, if not unjustifiable; and that, admitting it was
      right, humanity ought to have interposed and saved André.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing details render it unnecessary to discuss these points,
      either for the purpose of establishing truths, or of vindicating the
      character of Washington. Let every reader reflect upon the prominent
      transactions, and judge for himself. Nothing more is requisite. Was André
      a spy? This character he voluntarily acknowledged, both in his first
      letter to General Washington, and in his examination before the board of
      officers; that is, he confessed himself to have acted a part, which no one
      could possibly act, who was not a spy. He landed secretly in the night, he
      was concealed within the American lines, he changed his dress and appeared
      in disguise, he assumed a false name, he was taken while going to the
      enemy with papers containing intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      These facts were so well attested, that the British general, in his
      extreme solicitude to rescue André, did not attempt to evade or disprove
      them. It was the drift of his argument to show, that, notwithstanding
      their existence, André could not properly be considered a spy, first,
      because he went ashore under a flag of truce, and secondly, because while
      on shore he was subject to the directions of an American general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first point was not accurate in any sense, either literally or
      theoretically. It is true, Arnold had written a paper as a passport for
      Smith, in which he mentioned a flag; but there was no flag, and it was in
      the night, when flags are not sent except on extraordinary occasions.
      Moreover the business was not such as could ever be sanctioned by a flag,
      the whole design of which is to soften the rigors of war by creating a
      mutual confidence between hostile armies, and thereby opening a channel
      for reciprocal acts of humanity. The moment this signal of peace is
      employed to abuse the confidence of an opposing party, by seeking to
      inflict an injury under the mask of friendship, the act becomes infamous.
      Hence the prostitution of a flag is regarded by all civilized people as
      one of the basest crimes. It is surprising, therefore, that the idea of a
      flag should have been put forward in any shape as a favorable
      circumstance. No such hint came from André. On the contrary, when
      questioned upon the subject, he declared, in very positive terms, that he
      was not under the sanction of a flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the second branch of the argument, there can be no doubt, that after
      André landed he was within the sphere of Arnold's command, and acted in
      all respects either with his knowledge or by his direction. But this did
      not alter the nature of his conduct. He was still in disguise, with a
      false name, and carrying papers of a dangerous import to the enemy. To say
      that he was an agent in maturing treason is not certainly to make him the
      less a spy. So far from it, that, if possible, the offence is aggravated
      by this coincidence of character and objects. It was argued, that Arnold
      had a right, while in command, to give such directions as he did to André,
      and consequently that no law was violated in obeying them. Upon the same
      principle it may be said, that Arnold had a right to be a traitor, if he
      could bring his ends to pass by secret means and without detection. The
      sophistry is too shallow to need a refutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Sir Henry Clinton used these arguments in his endeavors to
      procure a release of André, yet he did not recur to them in the narrative
      which he sent to the British government, nor complain that they had been
      disregarded. He stated all the facts minutely, in connexion with a copy of
      the correspondence, but without uttering any censure against Washington or
      the board of officers, and without intimating an opinion, that the
      sentence was unjust, or that André could be regarded in any other light
      than as a spy. Had his sentiments been different, he would unquestionably
      have expressed them strongly on this occasion, and thrown upon his enemies
      the full measure of blame, which he conceived them to deserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      In publishing this event likewise to the army in general orders, Sir Henry
      Clinton maintained the same reserve, concerning the mode of Andréas death.
      "The unfortunate fate of this officer," said he, "calls upon the
      Commander-in-chief to declare, that he ever considered Major André a
      gentleman of the highest integrity and honor, and incapable of any base
      action or unworthy conduct." Nothing was added as to the manner of his
      death, nor was it even insinuated, that it had been caused by the
      vengeance, injustice, or any improper act of the enemy, in whose hands he
      suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are proofs, and more might be adduced, that the opinions of Sir
      Henry Clinton on this subject, namely, the light in which André was to be
      held, according to the invariable laws of war and of nations, were
      essentially the same as those of General Washington. It is said by M. de
      Marbois, that Washington secretly consulted Congress respecting André
      before he was examined. No formal deliberation was held upon the subject,
      but Congress returned as an answer, that they perceived no reason for
      arresting the course of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question, which is merely one of feeling and not of principle, whether
      André might not have been indulged in his last request to die a military
      death, should be answered in reference to the state of things at that
      crisis, and to the motives operating on Washington's mind. Regarding the
      matter only in the abstract, there seems no very obvious reason why such
      an indulgence should have been refused. Yet, as no trait in Washington's
      character was more remarkable through life than his humanity, this noble
      quality cannot be supposed to have forsaken him on an occasion, which most
      deeply interested his feelings, and enlisted his sympathies on the side of
      the sufferer. It must be recollected, that, when André was executed,
      Washington was entirely ignorant as to the extent of the conspiracy and
      the persons engaged in it. His fears and his suspicions were alive; and,
      both as an evidence that he deemed André's punishment just, and as a
      terror to others who might be concerned in the plot, he believed it a duty
      to his office and his country to let the law take its usual course. As the
      event turned out, no ill consequences could have resulted from a
      compliance with the request of André. Could this have been foreseen by
      Washington, the tenderness of his disposition, so often manifested,
      warrants us to believe, that no effort on his part would have been spared
      to soothe the dying moments of a brave and unfortunate man. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * A monument was erected by order of the King, in Westminster Abbey, to
      the memory of Major André. His remains were taken up, in the year 1821, by
      Mr. Buchanan, British Consul in New York, and removed to England. They
      were deposited in Westminster Abbey near the monument. André died at the
      age of twenty-nine. As no metallic buttons were found in the grave, when
      the disinterment took place, it was considered a proof, that he was not
      buried in his regimentals. It was inferred, that he had been stripped
      before burial; in what manner was uncertain. Dr. Thacher has shown, in his
      Observations, that André's regimentals were given to his servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captors of André were recommended by Washington to Congress, as worthy
      not only of thanks but of a more substantial recompense from the public.
      After expressing by a formal vote "a high sense of their virtuous and
      patriotic conduct," Congress granted to each of them an annual pension of
      two hundred dollars for life, and ordered a silver medal to be struck and
      presented to each, bearing on one side the inscription <i>Fidelity</i>,
      and on the other, <i>Vincit Amor Patrice</i>. These medals were given to
      the individuals by General Washington, at head-quarters, with some
      ceremony, and they were invited to dine with him on that occasion. In
      writing to the President of Congress, he said, "The recompense is ample;
      it is an evidence of the generosity of Congress, a flattering tribute to
      the virtue of those citizens, and must prove a powerful incitement to
      others to imitate their example." The country participated in this
      opinion, and the conduct of the captors was universally applauded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In connexion with this statement, however, it is proper to add, that
      doubts have been entertained as to the original motives and designs of
      Paulding, Van Wart, and Williams. The representation made by André to
      Major Tallmadge and Mr. Bronson was, that he first discovered these men
      playing at cards in the bushes near the road; that, after they had stopped
      him, they ripped up the housings of his saddle and the cape of his coat in
      search of money; but, finding none, one of the party said, "He may have it
      in his boots;" then they then pulled off his boots, and found the papers,
      which induced them to think he was a spy. Major André was of the opinion,
      that, if he could have given them a small sum of money at first, they
      would have allowed him to pass without further molestation; but he had no
      other money about his person, than the paper bills given to him by Smith,
      and merely sufficient to pay his expenses to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      So strong an impression did this account make upon the mind of Major
      Tallmadge, and so fully was he convinced of its accuracy, and of the
      dubious virtue of the captors, that, thirty-seven years afterwards, when
      Paulding petitioned Congress for an increase of pension, he resisted the
      petition, (being then a member of Congress,) on the ground that the
      conduct of the petitioner did not deserve such a testimony of public
      approbation and gratitude. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * The subject was drawn into a discussion, and several replies were made
      to Major Tallmadge. See a small volume entitled Vindication of the Captors
      of Major André, published in New York, 1817.
    </p>
    <p>
      May there not be a middle line between these two extremes? Was it not
      possible for the men to search for money, and still be true to their
      country, which is the only point at issue? When they stopped the
      traveller, the idea of a spy seems not to have occurred to them. They took
      him for a merchant, or a person engaged in mercantile business, not
      legally and openly, but in the manner practised by too many of the
      borderers of the neutral ground. They would naturally expect him to have
      money, and would search for it, especially after the confused manner in
      which he had spoken of himself, and since, if he was an enemy and had
      money, it would be theirs by the same prize-law, that afterwards assigned
      to them the horse, saddle, bridle, and watch. Their virtue cannot be
      impeached, therefore, merely on the score of their searching for money,
      although this incident, it must be confessed, contributes no special
      lustre to their motives or acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to their testimony before the court at Smith's trial, they did
      not suspect André of being a spy, till his boots had been pulled off and
      the papers discovered; nor is there any direct proof, that he offered them
      money to release him till after that discovery. Williams then asked him
      what he would give them to let him go, evidently having no other aim, than
      to obtain further knowledge of his character. André offered to give any
      sum of money, or quantity of dry goods, that they would name. Here was the
      trial of their virtue. Ten thousand guineas, they said, should not tempt
      them to let him escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major André believed, that, when he made the offer, they would have
      accepted it, if he could have given any security for the fulfilment of his
      promise. As he could only pledge his word, and as either he or some other
      person in his name must go into the city and bring out the money and
      goods, they distrusted his ability to execute his engagement, and feared
      that some cross accident would in the mean time lead them into difficulty,
      and prevent their getting any thing. As the surest course, or the one from
      which they were the most likely to obtain a reward, they resolved to take
      him within the American lines, and deliver him up to an officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Andre's belief, and it was perhaps favored by appearances. But
      all the prominent circumstances of the case are decidedly against it.
      Whatever the captors thought of their prisoner, they could not have
      imagined his real importance, nor foreseen the consequences that followed.
      They looked upon him as a common spy, and supposed that they would be
      suitably but not extravagantly rewarded for giving him up. If they were
      influenced only by motives of gain, it is hardly possible that they should
      not have been tempted by the golden offers of André, notwithstanding the
      uncertainty attending them, which could not be very great, since he
      proposed to stay where he was, till one of them should go into the city
      and bring out the money and other articles. Had they known Andre's
      character, the affair would assume a different aspect; but, as they did
      not, we must look for a higher determining principle, than a mere
      pecuniary calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exact degree in which we are to expect patriotism and genuine public
      virtue in men, who stand in the same class of society and follow the same
      pursuits as the captors of André, may be a question for casuistry to
      settle. But it will require more than the casuist's art to prove, that
      these men did not believe they were doing a valuable service to their
      country, distinct from any ulterior consideration, in committing to
      custody a person, whom they knew to be a spy, and who had offered them a
      large bribe for his release. We need not scrutinize motives too closely.
      The act was noble in itself, immensely important to the nation in its
      effects, and worthy of all praise as an example. This meed of justice let
      it receive from history, and from every citizen, who would by his
      approbation encourage instances of generous self-sacrifice for the public
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may be curious to know what became of Joshua H. Smith. We left
      him at Tap-pan under guard. He was tried by a court-martial, which was
      assembled the day after the examination of André, and continued by
      adjournments for about four weeks. Many witnesses were brought before the
      court, among whom were Lafayette, Knox, Hamilton, Harrison, Colonel
      Livingston, Colonel Hay, Captain Boyd, Paulding and Williams, and the two
      boatmen, who went on board the Vulture. The testimony was voluminous, as
      written out by the judge-advocate, and formed a mass of facts developing
      many of the secret incidents of the conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charge presented against Smith ran in these words; "For aiding and
      assisting Benedict Arnold, late major-general in our service, in a
      combination with the enemy to take, kill, and seize such of the loyal
      citizens or soldiers of these United States, as were in garrison at West
      Point and its dependencies." Smith drew up in writing a long defence,
      which he read to the court, and in which he first objected to its
      jurisdiction, saying that, being a citizen and not a soldier, he could not
      properly be subject to a military tribunal; he then summed up the evidence
      with considerable ability, and argued his cause. He was acquitted by the
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he had aided and assisted Arnold there was no doubt; this he
      confessed before the trial; but it was not proved by the evidence, that he
      had any knowledge of Arnold's traitorous designs. Considering the part he
      performed, this was extraordinary; but the court were fully justified in
      their decision. Some points in Smith's conduct, however, were never
      cleared up, especially his refusing to go back with André to the Vulture.
      The reason he assigned was improbable, and his attempts at an explanation
      only threw a deeper shade over his candor. Although no one would be
      willing to condemn Smith, upon the testimony adduced to the court, yet
      whoever reads it will be satisfied, that he could not have fallen into
      such extreme stupidity, as not to suspect something wrong in the business
      he was engaged in carrying on. Nor is it easy to imagine how a man of his
      intelligence and character could have been made a passive tool, even in
      the hands of so artful a hyprocrite as Arnold, for effecting purposes
      obviously of great moment, concerning which he was not allowed to have any
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      These impressions are strengthened by Smith's book, which he published
      many years afterwards in England, evidently with a copy before him of all
      the written testimony produced to the court at his trial; and in which he
      utters innumerable assertions widely different from the testimony itself
      and from his original defence, mingled with severe and bitter reflections
      upon several of the witnesses. *
    </p>
    <p class="foot">
      * The book is entitled An Authentic Narrative of the Causes which led to
      the Death of Major André. London. 1808.&mdash;Whether from a defect of
      memory in the author, or from whatever reason, needs not be inquired; but
      as a work of history this volume is not worthy of the least credit, except
      where the statements are confirmed by other authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after all, it would be unjust to charge Smith with positive guilt
      without farther proof; as it is impossible to believe him entirely
      innocent, without a more satisfactory explanation of his conduct than has
      yet appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers of the court-martial were read by Washington, and then
      transmitted to Governor Clinton, that Smith might be tried by a civil
      process under the laws of the State of New York, should such a course be
      deemed advisable. He was sent to West Point and released from military
      arrest, but he was immediately taken into custody by the civil authority
      of the state, and confined in the jail at Goshen. After remaining there
      several months without any trial, he found means to escape, and passed
      through the country, sometimes disguised in a woman's dress, to Paulus
      Hook and New York. At the close of the war he went to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arnold resolved to share the lot of her husband. She visited her
      friends at Philadelphia, and joined him in New York about the middle of
      November. In her travels through the country, she was everywhere treated
      with a respect and forbearance hardly to have been expected in the
      exasperated state of public feeling, which then prevailed; a proof, that,
      although unfortunate in her alliance with a traitor, she was not
      considered guilty of participating in his crimes. It is related by M. de
      Marbois, as a remarkable instance of moderation in the people, that, when
      on her journey she had stopped at a village to pass the night, where the
      inhabitants were preparing to burn her husband in effigy, they suspended
      the execution of their design till the next night, out of delicacy to her
      sex and situation. It is also said, that, when she entered her carriage in
      open day to go and join Arnold in the midst of the enemies of his country,
      no symptoms were exhibited of the detestation in which his name was held
      even by the lowest populace. This was the more worthy of notice, as his
      effigy had recently been paraded through the streets of Philadelphia with
      every mark of infamy, and every demonstration of resentment and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of Captain Nathan Hale has been regarded as parallel to that of
      Major André. This young officer was a graduate of Yale College, and had
      but recently closed his academic course when the war of the revolution
      commenced. Possessing genius, taste, and ardor, he became distinguished as
      a scholar; and, endowed in an eminent degree with those graces and gifts
      of nature which add a charm to youthful excellence, he gained universal
      esteem and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To high moral worth and irreproachable habits were joined gentleness of
      manners, an ingenuous disposition, and vigor of understanding. No young
      man of his years put forth a fairer promise of future usefulness and
      celebrity; the fortunes of none were fostered more sincerely by the
      generous good wishes of his associates, or the hopes and encouraging
      presages of his superiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a patriot upon principle, and an enthusiast in a cause, which
      appealed equally to his sense of justice and love of liberty, he was among
      the first to take up arms in his country's defence. The news of the battle
      of Lexington roused his martial spirit, and called him immediately to the
      field. He obtained a commission in the army, and marched with his company
      to Cambridge. His promptness, activity, and assiduous attention to
      discipline, were early observed. He prevailed upon his men to adopt a
      simple uniform, which improved their appearance, attracted notice, and
      procured applause. The example was followed by others, and its influence
      was beneficial. Nor were his hours wholly absorbed by his military duties.
      A rigid economy of time enabled him to gratify his zeal for study and
      mental culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the theatre of action was changed, and the army was removed to
      the southward. The battle of Long Island was fought, and the American
      forces were drawn together in the city of New York. At this moment it was
      extremely important for Washington to know the situation of the British
      army on the heights of Brooklyn, its numbers, and the indications as to
      its future movements. Having confidence in the discretion and judgment of
      the gallant Colonel Knowlton, who commanded a Connecticut regiment of
      infantry, he explained his wishes to that officer, and requested him to
      ascertain if any suitable person could be found in his regiment, who would
      undertake so hazardous and responsible a service. It was essential, that
      he should be a man of capacity, address, and military knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Knowlton assembled several of his officers, stated to them the
      views and desires of the General, and left the subject to their
      reflections, without proposing the enterprise to any individual. The
      officers then separated. Captain Hale considered deliberately what had
      been said, and finding himself by a sense of duty inclined to the
      undertaking, he called at the quarters of his intimate friend, Captain
      Hull (afterwards General Hull), and asked his opinion. Hull endeavored to
      dissuade him from the service, as not befitting his rank in the army, and
      as being of a kind for which his openness of character disqualified him;
      adding that no glory could accrue from success, and a detection would
      inevitably be followed by an ignominious death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hale replied, that all these considerations had been duly weighed,
      that "every kind of service necessary to the public good was honorable by
      being necessary," that he did not accept a commission for the sake of fame
      alone or personal advancement, that he had been for some time in the army
      without being able to render any signal aid to the cause of his country,
      and that he felt impelled by high motives of duty not to shrink from the
      opportunity now presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arguments of his friend were unavailing, and Captain Hale passed over
      to Long Island in disguise. He had gained the desired information, and was
      just on the point of stepping into a boat to return to the city of New
      York, when he was arrested and taken before the British commander. Like
      André, he had assumed a character, which he could not sustain; he was "too
      little accustomed to duplicity to succeed." The proof against him was so
      conclusive, that he made no effort at self-defence, but frankly confessed
      his objects; and, again like André, without further remarks "left the
      facts to operate with his judges." He was sentenced to be executed as a
      spy, and was accordingly hanged the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was conformable to the laws of war, and the prisoner was
      prepared to meet it with a fortitude becoming his character. But the
      circumstances of his death aggravated his sufferings, and placed him in a
      situation widely different from that of André. The facts were narrated to
      General Hull by an officer of the British commissary department, who was
      present at the execution, and deeply moved by the conduct and fate of the
      unfortunate victim, and the treatment he received. The provost-martial, to
      whose charge he was consigned, was a refugee, and behaved towards him in
      the most unfeeling manner; refusing the attendance of a clergyman and the
      use of a bible, and destroying the letters he had written to his mother
      and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these barbarities, Hale was calm, collected, firm; pitying
      the malice that could insult a fallen foe and dying man, but displaying to
      the last his native elevation of soul, dignity of deportment, and an
      undaunted courage. Alone, unfriended, without consolation or sympathy, he
      closed his mortal career with the declaration, "that he only lamented he
      had but one life to lose for his country." When André stood upon the
      scaffold, he called on all around him to bear witness, that he died like a
      brave man. The dying words of Hale embodied a nobler and more sublime
      sentiment; breathing a spirit of satisfaction, that, although brought to
      an untimely end, it was his lot to die a martyr in his country's cause.
      The whole tenor of his conduct, and this declaration itself, were such
      proofs of his bravery, that it required not to be more audibly proclaimed.
      The following tribute is from the muse of Dr. Dwight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Thus, while fond virtue wished in vain to save,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Hale, bright and generous, found a hapless grave;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With genius' living flame his bosom glowed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And science charmed him to her sweet abode;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In worth's fair path his feet adventured far,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The pride of peace, the rising grace of war."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a striking similarity between the character and acts of Hale and
      André, but in one essential point of difference the former appears to much
      the greater advantage. Hale was promised no reward, nor did he expect any.
      It was necessary, that the service should be undertaken from purely
      virtuous motives, without a hope of gain or of honor; because it was of a
      nature not to be executed by the common class of spies, who are influenced
      by pecuniary considerations; and promotion could not be offered as an
      inducement, since that would be a temptation for an officer to hazard his
      life as a spy, which a commander could not with propriety hold out. Viewed
      in any light, the act must be allowed to bear unequivocal marks of
      patriotic disinterestedness and self-devotion. But André had a glorious
      prize before him; the chance of distinguishing himself in a military
      enterprise, honors, renown, and every allurement, that could flatter hope
      and stimulate ambition. To say the least, his personal advantages were to
      be commensurate with the benefit to his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whatever may have been the parallel between these two individuals
      while living, it ceased with their death. A monument was raised and
      consecrated to the memory of André by the bounty of a grateful sovereign.
      His ashes have been removed from their obscure resting-place, transported
      across the ocean, and deposited with the remains of the illustrious dead
      in Westminster Abbey. Where is the memento of the virtues, the patriotic
      sacrifice, the early fate of Hale? It is not inscribed in marble; it is
      hardly recorded in books. Let it be the more deeply cherished in the
      hearts of his countrymen.

      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Narrative of Arnold's Plot communicated by Sir Henry Clinton to the
      Ministry.&mdash;Arnold in New York.&mdash;His Expedition against Virginia
      and New London.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter the return of
      General Robertson and the other Commissioners to New York, Sir Henry
      Clinton made still another effort to rescue Major André. He wrote a long
      letter to Washington, recapitulating the facts and reasonings already
      advanced, and claiming the release of his adjutant-general. He proposed to
      exchange for him Lieutenant Governor Gadsden, of South Carolina, who had
      been taken prisoner, and, with other persons under similar circumstances,
      sent to St. Augustine, in consequence of their having been detected in a
      correspondence with General Gates. A statement of particulars was also
      obtained from Captain Sutherland, respecting the manner in which André
      came on board the Vulture, and left it in the boat with Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      As neither the letter nor the statement contained any thing new, the
      object in writing them probably was to cause delay by protracting the
      negotiation. Before they were sent off, however, Major André's servant
      arrived in New York with the news of his execution; and thus all
      intercourse on the subject between the two commanders was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto no hints of this affair had been transmitted to the ministry;
      but, immediately after the catastrophe, a narrative of all the events was
      drawn up, signed by Sir Henry Clinton, and despatched to Lord George
      Germain. It commenced with the first advances made by Arnold, and pursued
      the train of incidents to the end. All the correspondence, respecting the
      capture of André and the means used for his release, was interspersed
      according to the dates of the respective letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conformably to the request of André, his commission was sold by Sir Henry
      Clinton for the benefit of his mother and sisters. In acquainting the
      minister with this transaction, he added; "But I trust your Lordship will
      think that Major André's misfortune still calls for some further support
      to his family; and I beg leave to make it my humble request, that you will
      have the goodness to recommend them in the strongest manner to the King
      for some beneficial and distinguishing mark of his Majesty's favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers were laid before the King by Lord George Germain, who replied
      to Sir Henry Clinton as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Majesty has read with much concern the very affecting narrative of
      Major André's capture, and the fatal consequences of that misfortune
      related in your letter; and his Majesty was graciously pleased to express
      his entire approbation of your having complied with his request of
      disposing of his commission for the advantage of his family. And I have
      the satisfaction to add, that his Majesty has further extended his royal
      bounty to Major André's mother, by the grant of a pension, and has offered
      to confer the honor of knighthood on his brother, in order to wipe away
      all stain from the family, that the ignominy of the death he was so
      unjustly put to might be thought to have occasioned. The beneficence of
      our gracious sovereign will thereby console the family for their private
      misfortune; but the public can never be compensated for the disappointment
      of the vast advantages, which must have followed from the success of your
      plan, which Major André's capture prevented. Nothing could have been more
      judiciously concerted; and, from the proof Mr. Arnold has since given of
      his sincerity, there is no reason to doubt it could have failed in its
      execution, especially as you proposed conducting it in person."
    </p>
    <p>
      The generous sentiments and noble conduct of the King, both in regard to
      the memory of André and the tokens of substantial kindness to his family,
      claim and must ever receive the highest applause. But the countenance
      shown to Arnold, the approbation of his infamy, and the distinctions and
      favors conferred upon him, will be viewed in a much more questionable
      light. If policy and military custom extend protection to a deserter, they
      can never demand nor even justify caresses to a traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was doubtless proper for Sir Henry Clinton to fulfil the promises he
      had made, and submit to the sacrifice with as good a grace as he could,
      notwithstanding the utter disappointment of all his expectations. He wrote
      to the minister; "I have paid to that officer six thousand three hundred
      and fifteen pounds sterling, as a compensation for the losses, which he
      informs me he has sustained by coming over to us. I make no doubt, that
      the expense will be cheerfully submitted to." It was gratuitous to charge
      this reward of treachery to the score of losses. Arnold's creditors were
      the chief losers by his defection, unless he set a large price upon the
      diminution of his rank, being appointed colonel of a regiment in the
      British service, with the brevet of brigadier-general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold had been but a few days with his new friends, when he published an
      <i>Address to the Inhabitants of America</i>, attempting to explain and
      vindicate the course he had pursued. Considering the cause he undertook to
      defend, it is no wonder that he should say little to the purpose. Abuse of
      Congress and of the French alliance was the principal theme of his
      discourse. "To the thousands," said he, "who suffer under the tyranny of
      the usurpers in the revolted provinces, as well as to the great multitude
      who have long wished for its subversion, this instance of my conduct can
      want no vindication; and as to that class of men, who are criminally
      protracting the war from sinister views, at the expense of the public
      interest, I prefer their enmity to their applause. I am therefore only
      concerned to explain myself to such of my countrymen, as want abilities or
      opportunities to detect the artifices by which they are duped." Having
      thus defined the description of persons for whom his address is intended,
      he proceeds to his defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceiving the rights of his country in danger, at the beginning of the
      contest, he thought it his duty to take up arms for their protection, but
      he aimed only at a redress of grievances. The declaration of independence
      was a measure, which at the time he believed precipitate, although he
      acquiesced in it; but all the reasons for this measure, however plausible
      when it was adopted, were completely removed by the subsequent proffers of
      the British government. The refusal to accede to these terms he ascribed
      to the tyrannical use of power in Congress, who studiously avoided
      submitting them to the people, and resisted every advance towards a
      negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspicions excited in his patriotic breast, by these and other
      indications of the temper and views of Congress, were more than confirmed
      when the treaty with France was ratified. He was shocked to find his
      country, by the folly and duplicity of its pretended leaders, thus tied to
      its "proud, ancient, and crafty foe, the enemy of the Protestant faith,
      who fraudulently avows an affection for the liberties of mankind, while
      she holds her native sons in vassalage and chains." His virtuous spirit
      could not brook such an enormity. From that hour he resolved to abandon a
      cause, sustained by iniquity and controlled by usurpers, in which he could
      no longer act with that pure and disinterested aim for the public good,
      which had always been the ruling motive of his conduct. He retained his
      arms and command only for a suitable opportunity to surrender them to his
      King in such a manner, that he might accomplish an event of decisive
      importance with the least effusion of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With respect to that herd of censurers," said he in conclusion, "whose
      enmity to me originates in their hatred to the principles by which I am
      now led to devote my life to the reunion of the British empire, as the
      best and only means to dry up the streams of misery, that have deluged
      this country, they may be assured, that, conscious of the rectitude of my
      intentions, I shall treat their malice and calumnies with contempt and
      neglect." Such was the tenor of Arnold's Address to his former fellow
      citizens of the United States. His next performance was a <i>Proclamation</i>
      to the officers and soldiers of the Continental army, particularly those
      who had "the real interest of their country at heart, and who were
      determined to be no longer the tools and dupes of Congress and of France."
      All such he invited to come over to the King's standard, holding out as a
      temptation, that they should be clothed, subsisted, and paid like the
      other troops in the British service, and receive the value of any horses,
      arms, or accoutrements, which they might bring with them. A bounty of
      three guineas was offered to every non-commissioned officer and private.
      Officers were to obtain rank in proportion to that which they had formerly
      held, and to the number of men who should accompany them. It was expected,
      that a colonel would bring with him or recruit in a reasonable time
      seventy-five men, a major fifty, a captain thirty, and a lieutenant
      fifteen. They were moreover to have the inestimable privilege of fighting
      for "true American liberty," which had so long been denied to them by
      their oppressors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its other topics the proclamation was little else than a repetition of
      the address. Abusive epithets were profusely applied to Congress and the
      French. The soldiers were told, that they had been robbed of their
      property, imprisoned, and dragged against their will to the field of
      battle; that they were the prey of avarice, the scorn of their enemies,
      and the pity of their friends; that America had become a land of widows,
      orphans, and beggars; and that no security any longer remained even for
      the consolations of that religion, for which their fathers had braved the
      ocean, the heathen, and the wilderness. Rising in the climax of absurdity,
      he goes on to say; "can you at this day want evidence, that the funds of
      your country are exhausted, or that the managers have applied them to
      their own private use? In either case you surely can no longer continue in
      their service with honor or advantage. Yet you have hitherto been their
      supporters in that cruelty, which, with an equal indifference to yours, as
      well as the labor and blood of others, is devouring a country, that, from
      the moment you quit their colors, will be redeemed from their tyranny."
    </p>
    <p>
      By appeals like these were the American soldiers called upon to desert
      their country, and rally under the banner of a traitor, who had sought the
      ruin of themselves, their friends, and the cause for which they had long
      borne arms and often exposed their lives. Such appeals would appear
      incredible even from so desperate and degraded a man, had not the
      infirmity of his understanding already been proved to be on a level with
      the depravity of his heart. The only wonder is, that a measure of such
      imbecile malevolence and hopeless folly should be sanctioned by the
      British commander, and published from day to day in the gazettes issued
      under his authority. How was it possible for him not to perceive, that the
      effect would be contrary to his interests and wishes? Who would join a
      traitor? Who would deliberately seek disgrace and infamy? And, above all,
      who would be cajoled by falsehood and malignity, as undisguised as they
      were audacious and wicked?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well informed as to the actual condition, principles, and feelings of the
      American soldiers, and aware that his proclamation would only excite
      indignation and disgust, Arnold adopted another expedient to keep his new
      friends in good humor, and convince them that in him they had gained an
      important acquisition. He represented to Sir Henry Clinton, that the
      bounty was much too small, and recommended an increase to ten guineas. He
      said the American soldiers were chiefly prevented from deserting, by the
      loss they would sustain in forfeiting their arrears of pay, which had now
      become large, on account of the poverty of the country and the wretched
      state of the American finances. Ten guineas he thought would dissolve this
      tie, and bring over as many deserters as could be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the bounty was prescribed by the government, and Sir Henry had no
      authority to allow more than three guineas, Arnold immediately wrote to
      the ministry, and laid his proposition before them, supporting it by such
      arguments as he could draw from his invention. In replying to Sir Henry
      Clinton on the subject, Lord George Germain said he did not think the
      amount of the proposed sum an objection to it, considering the vast
      importance of increasing the British army by a corresponding diminution of
      that under Washington; but he foresaw a very serious evil in the operation
      of the scheme, since it would tempt deserters to come over for the sake of
      the bounty, who, having pocketed the ten guineas, would find their way
      back again as soon as possible to the American camp. To avert this
      consequence, the minister suggested, that no more than the usual sum of
      three guineas should be paid at first, and the remaining seven when the
      regiment, to which the deserter was attached, should be reduced, or at the
      end of the war. Officers he thought should be liberally rewarded,
      especially if they brought with them the men they had before commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were supposed to be deterred from desertion by the fear of recapture.
      To obviate this difficulty, a project was set on foot for organizing them
      into regiments to be employed in the West Indies, or on the Spanish Main.
      This was favorable to Arnold's views, and it was approved by the King. No
      harm could result from it; and nearly the same benefits would accrue, as
      if they were engaged immediately under Sir Henry Clinton, since it would
      enable him to draw from the West Indies a corresponding force. But why it
      should be thought, that an American soldier would be allured from his home
      by the bounty of ten guineas and the almost certain prospect of finding a
      grave in a tropical climate, is not apparent. The experiment seems never
      to have been tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, there is no evidence that Arnold met with any success in his
      attempts to recruit from the American army. A few deserters and refugees,
      already within the British lines and not united with any corps, and
      particularly officers desirous of place and employment, nominally
      constituted his regiment, which was never so far completed as to be known
      either for its numbers or exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentiments of the British cabinet, in regard to the defection of
      Arnold, may be gathered from the minister's first letter to him after that
      event.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the pleasure to acquaint you," says Lord George Germain, "that his
      Majesty was graciously pleased to express his satisfaction in the
      demonstration you have given of the sincerity of your return to your
      allegiance, and of your earnest desire to atone for past errors by a
      zealous attachment to his royal person and government in future. And his
      Majesty has been graciously pleased to command me to signify to Sir Henry
      Clinton his royal approbation of the rank he has given you in the army
      under his command, and of his having appointed you to raise a corps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The intelligence transmitted in both of your letters shows the resources
      of Congress to be nearly exhausted, and their cause universally sinking,
      notwithstanding the boasted succors of their ally; and I am fully
      persuaded, that, were any disgrace at this time to happen to Mr.
      Washington's army, the inhabitants of many of the provinces would declare
      their wishes for peace with Great Britain, by returning to their
      allegiance; and it is the most distant from the intention of the King and
      of Parliament to abridge those liberties essential to their interests and
      happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of the intelligence, which afforded so much encouragement to
      the minister, is no further indicated. It is enough to know, however, that
      it was false and deceptive, and produced a mischievous influence. Misled
      by an erroneous impression, thus communicated, of the strength of the
      American army, and the condition and temper of the people, and willing to
      foster the smallest germ of hope, the ministry relaxed from exertion, at a
      moment when the full exercise of all their energies was most necessary.
      The man, now their friend and a faithful subject of the King, but who had
      been in a high station with the enemy from the beginning of the war, and a
      principal actor, they took it for granted must be well informed; and,
      strange to tell, they relied on his veracity. The consequences were
      severely felt by the British commander, who, in the bitterness of his
      disappointment, afterwards complained of this facility of faith and easy
      confidence on the part of his superiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arnold made such slow progress in recruiting his regiment, that he was
      impatient for more active service. Two months after he joined the British,
      he was appointed to the command of an expedition against Virginia,
      consisting of sixteen hundred effective troops. General Leslie had
      recently sailed from the Chesapeake, with the detachment under his
      command, to unite with Lord Cornwallis in the Carolinas. It was thought
      important to send another detachment to take his place in the waters of
      Virginia, and thus create a diversion in that quarter in, favor of
      Cornwallis, and prevent the Virginia troops from marching to the aid of
      General Greene.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of this division Arnold sailed from New York about the middle
      of December. In addition to his general directions to invade the country
      wherever an opportunity presented itself, he was particularly instructed
      to establish a post at Portsmouth on Elizabeth River, and to prepare
      materials for constructing a number of boats to be used in Albemarle
      Sound, and afterwards in the waters of the Chesapeake, when the season
      should be too far advanced for acting farther southward. He was also
      directed to assemble and arm the loyalists, but not to encourage any to
      join him, till there should be the fairest prospect of protecting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Henry Clinton proceeded with more caution than the ministry. He was
      not prepared to put implicit trust in a man, who had shown himself such an
      adept in the arts of dissimulation, so destitute of principle, and so
      regardless of honor. Colonel Dundas and Colonel Simcoe, two officers of
      tried ability and experience, and possessing the entire confidence of
      their commander, were sent in the expedition; and Arnold was expressly
      ordered not to adopt any measure, nor to undertake any important
      operation, without first consulting them and obtaining their approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent gale separated the fleet in which the detachment was embarked,
      but the scattered vessels united at the capes of the Chesapeake and
      entered Hampton Road on the 30th of December; except one armed ship and
      three transports, with upwards of four hundred men on board, which did not
      arrive till five days later. One half of the cavalry horses were lost, and
      several of the large guns were thrown into the sea to prevent the vessels
      from foundering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for the arrival of the transports that were missing,
      Arnold pushed up James River with his fleet aided by wind and tide, and
      immediately found himself in the heart of the country. His effective force
      consisted of about twelve hundred men. The burnings and plunderings, the
      destruction of public and private property, the ravages and distresses,
      which marked all his movements, were consistent with his character, and
      such as were to be expected. The inhabitants were not prepared for so
      sudden an invasion; the militia could not be rallied in time to resist it.
      A small force was assembled under Baron Steuben, on the south side of
      James River, but too distant to act efficiently till it was too late.
      After striking at every assailable point, Arnold called his troops back to
      the ships, descended the river, and took his station at Portsmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attempts to defeat and capture him in that post; the spirited and well
      conducted enterprise under Lafayette; the French naval armament sent from
      Newport, and commanded by M. de Tilly; the more formidable one under M.
      Destouches; his rencounter with the fleet of Admiral Graves; the movements
      of General Phillips's detachment of British troops; and the subsequent
      operations in Virginia; all these are matters of history and not suited to
      the present narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong hopes were entertained by Washington, that Lafayette in concert
      with M. de Tilly would succeed in seizing Arnold, before any reinforcement
      could arrive from New York; but these hopes were disappointed by
      incidents, that could not have been foreseen or prevented. After entering
      Hampton Road, M. de Tilly found the depth of water in Elizabeth River not
      sufficient to receive his ships. Arnold was therefore beyond his reach at
      Portsmouth; and the detachment of Lafayette could not act without a naval
      superiority in the Chesapeake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Arnold been captured, it was the intention of Washington, that he
      should be immediately executed; and in his instructions to Lafayette, he
      enjoined it upon him to admit no terms of capitulation, which should
      screen a traitor from the punishment justly due to his crimes. Several
      weeks afterwards, when, upon the death of General Phillips, the command of
      the British troops in Virginia devolved temporarily upon Arnold, he
      attempted to correspond with Lafayette, and sent an officer to him with a
      flag of truce. When Lafayette opened the letter, and saw Arnold's name at
      the bottom, he refused to read it, saying to the officer that he would
      hold no correspondence whatever with him. Lord Cornwallis told Lafayette
      afterwards, that, as soon as he joined the army in Virginia, he took the
      first occasion to send Arnold down to Portsmouth, and expressed disgust at
      the idea of associating with a person of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during this expedition, that Arnold asked a captain, who had been
      taken prisoner, what he thought the Americans would do with him, if he
      should fall into their hands. "They will cut off the leg," replied the
      officer, "which was wounded when you were fighting for the cause of
      liberty, and bury it with the honors of war, and hang the rest of your
      body on a gibbet."
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things were going on, Sir Henry Clinton received a letter from
      Lord George Germain, little suited to increase his respect for the
      judgment, good sense, or honesty of his new American brigadier. Among
      other inventions to please the ministry, Arnold had represented the
      facility with which West Point might be taken, if not by a <i>coup de main</i>,
      yet by a few days' regular attack, and had proposed a sort of plan for
      that object. Lord George Germain expressed some degree of surprise, that
      the British commander had not undertaken the business, or at least
      mentioned his intention of doing it. "Such is the present state of Great
      Britain," said he, "that every possible means must be employed for the
      reduction of the rebellion," and he urged a serious consideration of the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      These suggestions, to say the least, were a tacit censure upon Sir Henry
      Clinton, for his want either of discernment or enterprise. He felt their
      force, and could not entirely conceal his displeasure. In his reply,
      however, he proved the folly of the scheme, and the impossibility of its
      execution, according to his view of the state of affairs, with the reduced
      force then at his command. "As to Major-General Arnold's opinion," he
      observed, "I can only say, that, whatever he may have represented to your
      Lordship, nothing he has as yet communicated to me on the subject has
      convinced me that the rebel posts in the Highlands can be reduced by 'a
      few days' regular attack.' But if he convinces me now, in the present
      reduction of the rebel army, that such a thing is practicable, (for to
      fail would be death to our cause in the present state of the war,) I shall
      most likely be induced to make the attempt. I have therefore required that
      general officer to send his plan of operation to me without delay, and to
      follow or accompany it himself." This was written on the 5th of April,
      1781, and Arnold returned, a few weeks afterwards, to New York, thus
      escaping the fate that might otherwise have awaited him at Yorktown.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he explained himself to Sir Henry Clinton is not known. We hear no
      more of the project against West Point, and Arnold seems to have remained
      in idleness during the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in September, however, an enterprise was set on foot, which, from
      his knowledge of the place of action and other circumstances, he doubtless
      originated. At New London were deposited public stores; and private
      property to a considerable amount was known to be on board the vessels in
      the harbor, feebly defended by Fort Trumbull on one side of the river, and
      Fort Griswold on the other. Here was an opportunity, too tempting to be
      resisted, for gaining plunder, gratifying a vindictive spirit, and
      rendering a service to the cause, which he had espoused, and in aid of
      which he had hitherto done so little either to sustain his military
      reputation, or mark the value of his dearly bought allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Departing from the opposite shore of Long Island, with a force adequate to
      the undertaking, he crossed the Sound, and landed his troops in two
      divisions at the mouth of the river. One division marched towards New
      London, took Fort Trumbull, and entered the town. The other, passing up
      the east side of the river, ascended the high grounds to Fort Griswold,
      which, after a short but sanguinary conflict, was carried at the point of
      the bayonet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The details of these tragical scenes have often been described, and need
      not here be recapitulated. New London was reduced to ashes. Several
      vessels in the harbor shared the same fate. Others escaped up the river
      towards Norwich. The brave Colonel Ledyard, who commanded in Fort
      Griswold, was slain by his own sword, when he gave it into the hands of
      the officer, who headed the assailing party; and many of his companions in
      arms, inhabitants of the little village of Groton, who had assembled at a
      moment's warning to defend their homes and their firesides, were butchered
      in cold blood after the fort was surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said, that Arnold, while New London was in flames, stood in
      the belfrey of a steeple, and witnessed the conflagration; thus, like
      Nero, delighted with the ruin he had caused, the distresses he had
      inflicted, the blood of his slaughtered countrymen, the anguish of the
      expiring patriot, the widow's tears and the orphan's cries. And what adds
      to the enormity is, that he stood almost in sight of the spot where he
      drew his first breath; that every object around was associated with the
      years of his childhood and youth, and revived those images of the past,
      which kindle emotions of tenderness in all but hearts of stone; that many
      of the dying, whose groans assailed his ears, and of the living, whose
      houses and effects he saw devoured by the flames, were his early friends,
      the friends of his father, his mother, his family; and, in short, that
      these wanton acts of barbarity were without provocation on the part of the
      sufferers, and not less iniquitous in the motives whence they sprang, than
      shocking to humanity in themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the last exploit of Arnold in his native country. It was indeed
      the closing scene of his military and public career. And he had done
      enough. Nothing more was necessary to unfold his character in all the
      variety of its resources and depth of its depravity, or to convince the
      world, that, when a man once abandons himself to his passions, contemns
      the counsels of wisdom and virtue, sears his conscience, confounds duty
      with selfishness and honor with revenge, the descent is easy and rapid to
      that state in which he is the object, not more of the reproach and scorn
      of mankind, than of their pity and contempt.

      <i>Arnold sails for England.&mdash;Anecdotes.&mdash;His Residence at St.
      John's, and in the West Indies.&mdash;His Death.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he capitulation at
      York town having virtually put an end to the war, and Arnold finding
      himself neither respected by the British officers, nor likely to be
      further employed in the service, obtained permission from Sir Henry
      Clinton to go to England. He sailed from New York with his family in
      December, 1781. Sir Henry gave him a letter of introduction to Lord George
      Germain, mentioning his "spirited and meritorious conduct since he had
      joined the British army," and commending him to his "Lordship's
      countenance and protection"; but, forbearing to recount the instances of
      his worthy deeds, he referred the minister on that head to the tenor of
      his previous correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Arnold lived twenty years after this date, yet so entirely did he
      sink out of notice, that hardly an incident respecting him has been
      related or remembered. Happily no one will regret the blank. All that can
      be ascertained, in regard to his subsequent history, may be gathered from
      half a dozen anecdotes. Some of these are characteristic; others show in
      what utter disgrace he was held by the whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time he was about to sail from New York, two Scotch officers,
      wishing to return to England, requested a passage in the same vessel. The
      captain told them, that General Arnold had taken the whole cabin for
      himself and family, and that there was no more room for passengers; but,
      if they could make an arrangement with him, there would be no other
      obstacle. They accordingly consulted Arnold, who agreed to receive them
      into the cabin. Nothing further was said on the subject, till the vessel
      arrived in London. The Scotch gentlemen then went to the captain, and
      offered to pay for their passage, but he declined taking the money, and
      referred them to Arnold. He did not see them again, till they departed for
      Scotland. When Arnold came to pay his bill, he insisted that the
      proportion for their passage should be deducted. To this the captain would
      not consent, alleging that he had no claim upon the officers, and
      requiring a fulfilment of his contract. As this could not be evaded,
      Arnold was obliged to pay the demand, but he persuaded the captain to draw
      on the two officers, in favor of Arnold, and in his own name as captain of
      the ship, for their passage money. The draft came back protested. Arnold
      prosecuted the captain, and recovered the amount. It had also been paid to
      him by the officers before they left London.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been seen in the preceding narrative, that the horse on which
      Arnold rode in the second battle of Behmus's Heights was shot under him,
      just as he was entering the Hessian redoubt. The animal was a beautiful.
      Spanish horse, which had formerly belonged to Governor Skene, but was now
      the property of Colonel Lewis, and borrowed by Arnold for the occasion. A
      short time after the action, Colonel Lewis called on him, and requested a
      certificate of the horse having been killed, that he might obtain the
      value of him, according to usage, from the public treasury. Arnold
      declined giving the certificate, saying it would have an ill appearance
      for a major-general to sign a certificate for a horse, that had been shot
      under him in battle. Lewis said no more, till Arnold was about to leave
      the camp, when he again went to him, and insisted on being allowed a
      proper compensation for the loss of his horse. Arnold still assigned
      motives of delicacy for refusing a certificate, but told Lewis that he had
      a fine Narraganset mare in the public stables, which he would give him in
      the place of his horse, and immediately wrote an order to the keeper of
      the stables, directing him to deliver the mare into the hands of Colonel
      Lewis. Meantime Arnold went off, and two or three days afterwards the
      order was presented. The keeper said there was no mare belonging to
      General Arnold in the stables; that there had been one of that description
      some time before, but she was sold to another officer, who had taken her
      away. It was subsequently ascertained, that Arnold sent in a certificate,
      and received pay from the government for the horse that had been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this the end of the affair. When he was on the point of sailing
      for England, he borrowed two hundred dollars from a Captain Campbell in
      the British service, for which he gave an order on Colonel Lewis, telling
      Campbell that Lewis owed him for a mare purchased three years before, and
      that, as he was about to leave the country, and should not have an
      opportunity to collect the debt, it would be a convenience to him if
      Campbell would undertake that small service. Captain Campbell, having been
      acquainted with Colonel Lewis before the war and expecting to see him
      again, took the order as an equivalent for his two hundred dollars. When
      the news of peace arrived in New York, a passport was obtained from
      General Washington by the British commander, for a person to proceed
      through the country with the intelligence to the Governor of Canada.
      Captain Campbell was the bearer of the message, and on the way he visited
      his friend Lewis in Albany, and presented Arnold's order. Their mutual
      surprise may be imagined, both having been equal sufferers by this
      refinement of knavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the King, and a few persons in authority, were obliged from
      policy to take some notice of Arnold, after he went to England, yet he was
      shunned and despised by every body else. It is said, that when the
      petition for a bill authorizing a negotiation of peace was presented to
      the King in the usual form by Parliament, Arnold was standing near the
      throne, apparently in high favor with the sovereign. Lord Lauderdale is
      reported to have declared, on returning to the House, "that however
      gracious might be the language he had heard from the throne, his
      indignation could not but be highly excited at beholding his Majesty
      supported by a traitor." At another time, when Lord Surry had risen to
      speak, seeing Arnold in the gallery, he sat down quickly, pointing to him
      and exclaiming, "I will not speak while that man is in the House."
    </p>
    <p>
      He occasionally by accident met his countrymen, who uniformly treated him
      in the most slighting and contemptuous manner. An officer of rank in the
      American army, who had known him in early life, was in London. Arnold
      called at the door of his lodgings, and sent in his name. "Tell the
      gentleman I am not at home," said the officer to the servant, "and never
      shall be for General Arnold."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after the war, he took up his residence at St. John's, in New
      Brunswick, and resumed his old profession of a merchant, engaging
      principally in the West India trade. It is believed that the government
      granted him facilities, in the way of contracts for supplying the troops
      in Jamaica with provisions. At any rate he carried on a thriving and
      extensive business at St. John's, building ships on his own account and
      sending them to the West Indies.
    </p>
    <p>
      His style of living was ostentatious and profuse, exhibiting more splendor
      than was usual in provincial towns, and thus enabling him to associate on
      terms of intimacy with the higher classes; but he contrived to make
      himself odious to the people, not less by his haughty deportment, than by
      his habits of dishonesty in business. The inhabitants of St. John's were
      principally refugees from the United States, who had settled there at the
      close of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incident happened, which had a tendency to increase the strong feeling
      of distrust and aversion, with which he had from the first been regarded.
      He had in use two warehouses. Upon one of these, which was supposed to be
      filled with goods, he procured an insurance for a large amount. It took
      fire in the night, and was burnt to the ground with all its contents.
      Arnold was himself absent on a voyage to England. Two of his sons slept in
      the warehouse, and were there when the flames broke out, but could give no
      account of the manner in which the fire was communicated. The
      circumstances of the case induced a suspicion, that the goods had been
      insured much above their value, and that the building was intentionally
      set on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many particulars favored this construction, that the insurers refused
      to pay their bonds. Arnold prosecuted them on his return from England, and
      a trial ensued, in which many witnesses were examined; but no proof was
      produced to establish the charge of design in setting the fire, and he
      recovered the full value for which the goods had been insured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judicial decision did not accord, however, with public sentiment, and
      the populace resolved to express their sense of the transaction in a
      manner, that could not be misunderstood. They made an effigy, which they
      called <i>The Traitor</i>, and hung it in a conspicuous place, so that it
      could be seen from Arnold's windows. A concourse of people was gathered
      around it, when a magistrate appeared among them and read the riot act.
      This dispersed or quieted them for the moment, but they soon reassembled,
      and exposed the effigy anew. The military at last interfered, and put an
      end to the proceedings, but not till the people had effected their object,
      and committed to the flames the symbol of their indignation; and indeed it
      may be supposed, that neither the magistrates nor the military were
      over-earnest to suppress the popular feeling on this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long Arnold continued at St. John's is uncertain. He went back to
      England, where he resided the rest of his life, though he was sometimes
      absent on business in the West Indies. When the war with France commenced,
      he petitioned for employment in the army; but, as no officers would serve
      or associate with him, the petition could not be granted. A single
      adventure will include all that remains to be told of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at Point Petre, in Guadaloupe, engaged in commercial pursuits, when
      that Island, which had fallen under the power of the English, was retaken
      by the French. Having acted as an agent to furnish provisions for the
      British troops in the West Indies, chiefly obtained through a circuitous
      channel from the United States, he had accumulated a good deal of money,
      which was then in his possession. Fearful that it might be taken from him,
      or at least doubtful what treatment he would meet with if discovered, he
      assumed the name of Anderson. With other persons he was put on board a
      French prison-ship in the harbor. A sentinel told him, that he was known
      and exposed to great hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed at this intelligence, he immediately formed a plan to escape. His
      ingenuity and resource had seldom failed him in cases requiring promptness
      of decision, and they proved equally true to him at the present critical
      juncture. He enclosed his treasure in an empty cask, which he let down
      into the sea as soon as it was dark, and the waves carried it ashore near
      the place where the English were encamped. He likewise took the precaution
      to put a letter into the cask, stating that the property belonged to him,
      and was to be given up when demanded. In the middle of the night he
      silently descended the side of the ship, and placed himself upon a raft of
      planks prepared for the purpose, with which he had the good fortune to
      reach a small boat moored at some distance. He then rowed towards the
      English fleet, guided by the lights on board. Although hailed by a French
      guard-boat, he escaped under the cover of darkness, and at four o'clock in
      the morning was safe on the deck of a British vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this adventure, Arnold returned again to England. He died in
      London, June 14th, 1801, aged sixty-one years.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
